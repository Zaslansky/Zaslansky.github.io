# Creativity in Morphology
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### Today's Plan

- Productivity vs. Creativity

- Making new words

- Creativity

- Reanalysis

- An alternative view of morphology

---

# Productivity vs. Creativity

---

### Some uses of morphemes are *productive*

- They are understandable, and feel *right*!

- Describe -> Describable

- Describe -> Described

- Indescribably right!

---

### Productive processes are boring

- They feel perfectly grammatical

- They're perfectly understandable

- They're easy to interpret

---

### Some usages are *creative*

- They're understandable, but a bit off

- "Unbreak my heart, uncry these tears"

- "Can you stop linguisting and help me vacuum?"

- "Put down the haterade"

- "The problem was solved computeringly"

---

### Creative processes raise eyebrows

- They are usually understandable

- ... but they don't feel super legal

- ... and they can take a moment to figure out

    - ( ... the computeringliest solution)

---

### Creativity can often be a form of wordplay

---

N-now th-that that don't kill me

Can only make me stronger

I need you to hurry up now

'Cause I can't wait much longer

I know I got to be right now

'Cause I can't get much wronger

 --*Kanye West's 'Stronger'*

---

### Productivity and Creativity are a continuum

- It's hard to say when an affix is being used 'off label'

- Measurements of how 'innovative' a usage is are tough to do

- There's not a hard and fast line

    - ... and the distinguishability of the two is a theoretical question

---

### Creativity comes in many forms

- We've talked about applying morphemes out of their productive domain

- Sometimes, you're making up new words entirely!

---

# Word Creation

---

### We have many ways to create new words

- We've talked about derivational morphology

- ... but there are other processes

---

### Common Word Creation Methods

- Blending
- Clipping
- Acronyms
- Backcronyms
- Initialisms
- Univerbation
- Metaphorical Extension
- Coining
- Borrowing

---

### Blending multiple words

- Trendetarian

    - Eats whatever is trendy (Trendy+Vegetarian?)
    
- Staycation

    - A vacation at home (Stay+Vacation)

- Frenemy

    - Somebody who is both a friend and an enemy
    
- Mansplain

    - To condescendingly explain something (from Man+Explain)
    
- Backcronym

    - "Backwards Acronym"

---

### Clipping existing words

- Fam

    - From "Family"

- Cray

    - From "Crazy"
    
- Totes

    - From "totally"
    
- He caught an L

    - From "Loss"
    
- Feels

---

### Creating Acronyms

- *Acronyms are pronounceable!*

- Bobo

    - 'Bohemian bourgeois'
    
- JSOC

    - 'Joint special operations command'
    
- NASA

    - 'National Aeronautics and Space Administration'
    
- Thot

    - 'That hoe over there'
    
---

### Backronyms

- "hodl"

    - "Hold on for dear life"
    
- USA PATRIOT Act

    - "Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism"
    
---

### Creating Initialisms

- *Initialisms are pronounced as a series of letters*

- UCSD

    - University of California San Diego
    
- FBI
  
    - Federal Bureau of Investigation
    
- IPA

    - International Phonetic Alphabet
    - Or India Pale Ale, to some weirdos

---

### Univerbations

- over-the-top

- unheard of

- through-street

- under-the-table

- netflix and chill

---

### Metaphorical Extension

- spam

- mouse

- salty

- to pitch (a sale)

- to shift (a car)

---

### Coining brand new words!

- Bling

- doggo

- dongle

- uwu

- xerox

---

### What other new words can you think of?

---

### Do we always work with whole words or known affixes?

---

## No!

---

### Last time, we talked about losing affixes

---

<section data-background="img/parchment.jpg">

*... and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the morpheme passed out of all knowledge.  Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.*

---

# Reanalysis

---

### Morphological Analysis is what we've been doing

- "Where are the boundaries between these morphemes?"

- "What does each of these morphemes mean?"

---

### Morphological Analysis is something that happens over and over!

- ... and anything that happens over and over, can change!

- Speakers will sometimes re-segment words to create new affixes

- Kids learn something as an affix that was once a part of a monolithic word

---

### Morphological Reanalysis

"A change in the structure of a word that does not involve any immediate or intrinsic modification of its surface manifestation" (Paraphrased from Langacker 1977)

---

### Resegmentation is the most common type of morphological reanalysis

- Re-evaluating the presence, absence, or location of morpheme boundaries *within an existing word!*

- "No, older generation, that's analyzeable!"

---

### Resegmentation 

<img class="wide" src="ling_memes/germany.jpg">

---

### Cran-

<img class="wide" src="morphology/cran.jpg">

---

### This often happens with borrowings

- Pease -> Peas -> Pea

- Statistics -> Statistic

- Burglar -> Burgle

- Tamales -> Tamale

- Euthanasia -> Euthanize

---

### Sometimes, these are modern words

- Babysitter -> Babysit

- Bookkeeper -> Bookkeep

- Dingy -> Dinge

- Mentor -> Mentee

- Taser -> Tase

- Typewriter -> Typewrite

---

### Speakers can differ in their acceptance of these forms

- Uncouth -> Couth?

- Enthusiasm -> Enthuse?

- Disgruntled -> Gruntled?

- Disdained -> Dained?

---

### An affix is born!

- # <clr>Alcohol</clr><clb>ic</clb>

- # <clr>Alc</clr><clb>oholic</clb>

---

### -oholic is now a *productive* affix

- Chocoholic

- Workaholic

- Enchiladaholic

- (Does this mean that Catholics really like cats?)

---

### Arnold Zwicky coined a term for these: 'libfix'

- -burger
- -tard
- -naut
- Cran-
- -gate

---

## Wow, we're really creative!

---

### Indeed!

- This is why we're teaching this class from a strongly *analytic* perspective!

- We can't teach you faster than speakers can innovate

- Morphology is an active, ongoing process

    - You need to be active, ongoing linguists!

---

# An alternative viewpoint

---

### Reanalysis is the splitting of monolithic words into affixes

- We're discovering affixes within whole words using *analogy* within the lexicon

- "These are usually stored and accessed as whole words, but I guess these parts all do the same thing"

    - "I'll bet I could snap off that component alone and use it!"

---

### What if that's how *all of morphology* works?

---

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/whoa.jpg">

---

### Recall Split vs. Single Component Morphology

<img class="tall" src="diagrams/split_morphology_redirected.jpg">

---

### Both approaches make an assumption

<img class="wide" src="morphology/sandwich_shop.jpg">

---

### Are words really 'built to order'?

- "Let's see, I need to talk about gluing this thing, again, in the past.  That's 'glue', plus 're-', and '-ed'."

- "OK!  One 'reglued' coming up!"

---

### Or are we just choosing from the vending machine?

<img class="tall" src="morphology/vending_machine.jpg">

---

### Words may be grabbed whole from the lexicon

- "Let's see, I need to talk about gluing this thing, again, in the past. Looks like 'reglued' is the meaning I need!"

    - "Comes with cheese, egg salad, and phonology"

- \<inserts bills, punches A6\>

---

### We'll talk more about this idea soon!

- ... but be thinking about the possibilities and predictions

---

### Wrapping Up

- Productive uses of words are easily interpretable and friction free

- Creative uses of words take a bit more effort, but we can get there

- New words can be created through many processes

- Existing words can be reanalyzed, allowing the parts to be usable

- ... and maybe that's how all of this works!

---

### For Next Time

- We'll talk more about a morpheme-based lexicon
