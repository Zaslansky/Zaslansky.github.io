# The Vestibular System

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- The Anatomy of the Vestibular System

- How do we sense rotation?

- How do we sense head position?

- How do we sense linear acceleration?

- Balance and Orientation beyond the Vestibular System

- Symptoms of Vestibular Disorders

---

## Any questions?

---

### This isn't a well-balanced introduction

- This could be a whole quarter

- Instead, it's 45 minutes

- We'll just hit the high points

---

## The Anatomy of the Vestibular System

---

### We've been seeing the vestibular system all quarter!

---

## The Vestibular Anatomy

---

### The Semicircular Canals

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_kramer.jpg">

---

### The Semicircular Canals

- These detect rotational motion

- Three loops ('Superior', 'Posterior', and 'Horizontal')

	- These are roughly orthogonal to one another

- Filled with endolymph

	- Yes, the same endolymph, with the same K+ content!

---

### The Ampullae

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_anatomy.jpg">

---

### The Ampullae

- Each canal has an ampulla

- Within it is the crista ampullaris

- This is a mass of stereocilia with a gelatinous 'cupula' on top

- The cupula has a very specific density, so it's neutrally buoyant within the endolymph

	- This keeps gravity from affecting it!

---

### The Ampulla

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_cupula.jpg">

---

### The Utricle and Saccule

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_anatomy.jpg">

---

### The Utricle and Saccule

- Sense horizontal (utricle) and vertical (utricule) acceleration and static tilt

- A 'bed' of hair cells with the 'otolithic membrane' on top

- On the otolithic membrane are otoliths 

	- Also known as "otoconia" and "statoliths"

	- Little crystals of Calcium Carbonate

---

### The Utricle and Saccule

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_utricle.jpg">

---

### The Vestibular Nerve

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

## How do we detect rotation?

---

### The Semicircular Canals

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_kramer.jpg">

---

### The three canals provide three axes worth of data

- One canal doesn't give enough information

- If you can detect rotation on each, you have a 3D model

	- Especially combined with the other ear!

- ... but how do we detect the rotation?

---


### When the head moves, the fluid moves too

- ... but not at the same time

- Fluids have inertia in tubes

- To detect rotation, just detect the fluid moving in the ear!

---

### The Ampullae and Cristae

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_cupula.jpg">

---

### The Cristae transduce fluid movements into nerve signals

- The Cupula is a gelatinous 'sail' on top of the stereocilia

- When the fluid moves, it pushes the cupula

- When the cupula moves, the stereocilia are deflected

---

### Hair cells work similarly to the IHCs in detecting the signal

- Movement opens of hair cell tip links

- Ion Concentrations inside the cell change

- The cell depolarizes, and the nerve firing rates increase

---

### This works bilaterally

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/vestibular_movement.jpg">

---

### Bilateral Information

- Opposite 'ears' provide opposite effects

- Fluid motions are reversed because the orientation is reversed

- "Right is discharging more, left is discharging less"

---

### ... but we're missing something

- Rotation is not orientation

	- "How do you know what direction's up when you just woke up?"

- We also need to be able to sense acceleration

	- "I'm not turning, but the elevator's going up"

---

## How do we sense head position?

---

### There's one really useful fact about evolving on a planet

---

### Gravity!

- Maybe you've noticed it

- That force that makes things accelerate towards the Earth at around 9.8 m/s/s

- We can use this for positional reckoning

---

### The Non-Ear Way

- "Huh, when I stick my arm out it, it's wanting to move that way"

	- "That direction must be down!"

- Similar sensations are available to the legs, and head too!

---

### The Utricle and Saccule do the same thing

- "Let's use streocilia to detect the pull of gravity!"

- The Utricle and Saccule have beds of stereocilia positioned on the vertical and horizontal planes

	- The stereocilia do exactly what we expect them to do with ions and tip links and such

- The stereocilia should bend towards gravity

---

### ... but there's a problem

- Stereocilia are very lightweight!

---

### Enter the Otoliths

- The Otoliths are little tiny ear rocks ('otoliths') 

- They're attached to the membrane atop the stereocilia

- Literally their only role is to be a bit heavy

- Changes in position cause gravity to pull on the otoliths differently

---

### Changes in position change the firing patterns

- In the utricle, neutral vertical head position produces a baseline

- Leaning one direction, gravity bends the stereocilia, opening tip links, depolarizing and firing

- Leaning the other way, gravity bends the stereocilia the other way, closing tip links and hyperpolarizing

- Head position is interpretable from the combination of activation states of the utricule and saccule

---

### This is a constant feed

- (Meaningful) data only comes from the Cristae when there's rotation

- We are constantly getting orientation data from the utricle and saccule

- You never don't know which way is up!

- ... but rotation's not the only kind of movement that we care about

---

## How do we sense linear acceleration?

---

### We sense rotational movement with the cristae

- Movement around the axis of a semicircular canal produces endolymph flow

- But linear movement doesn't

	- The fluid just presses against the walls of the rings

- How do we detect linear movement?

---

### Evolve sensation of position, get linear acceleration for free!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/tubeguy.jpg"><img class="r-stretch" src="img/tubeguy.jpg">

---

### The Utricle and Saccule can detect linear acceleration caused by gravity

- ... but they can detect other acceleration at the same time

- Both in strength of movement and in directionality

- "Both the Utricle and the Saccule are firing?  We must be accelerating on two axes!"

	- "... and only one of those can be gravity"

- This allows us to sense vertical and horizontal acceleration!

---

### What a great deal!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/tubeguy.jpg"><img class="r-stretch" src="img/tubeguy.jpg">

---

## Balance and Orientation beyond the Vestibular System

---

### The Vestibular System is only part of the balance story

- The human brain is amazing at integrating matrices of sensory information

- The vestibular system provides useful data, but it's not the only data

---

### Musculoskeletal, Proprioceptive, and Tactile Information

- "Huh, when I relax my arm, it goes that way"

- "One side of my neck is extended, the other side is compacted"

- "I'm abruptly feeling greater weight on my feet without moving any part of my body"

- "My clothes are tight against me here, and draped away there"

---

### Visual balance and position perception

- "Which direction is the horizon going?"

- "Hmm, I don't think that tree and the ground it's on are actually rotating in space"

- "Huh, I moved my head and the whole world turned.  Am I a wizard?"

---

### When these things are 'out of sync', we hate it

- 'Motion sickness' comes from vestibular and proprioceptive registration of motion without visual motion

- "VR nausea" can come from visual registration of motion without vestibular or tactile

- When the vestibular system is giving bad information, we have a big problem!

	- Because lots of normal reflexes rely on it!

	- Speaking of which...

---

### The Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex

- Our vestibular system interacts with our visual senses

- When the head moves, the vestibular system feeds motion commands directly to the eyes

- "Move with me if you want to remain fixated on a distinct point"

- When the vestibular system is working poorly, this causes Nystagmus!
    
	- Unexpected eye movements which are very diagnostic...

---

## Symptoms of Vestibular Problems

---

### Nystagmus

- Which is both indicative, and annoying

- Causes visual disruption and is not pleasant

---

### Balance issues

- Difficulty registering absolute position

- Falling and tipping

---

### Vertigo

- Dizziness with rotation

- Often accompanied by nystagumus

---

### Nausea and Vomiting

- Obviously

---

### Hearing loss often co-occurs

- "Wow, diseases which affect stereocilia and endolymph-driven sensory apparati often affect hearing too!"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/surprisedpikachu.jpg">

---

### Vestibular problems are very problematic

- Vertigo and balance issues make for a difficult life

- We can manage the causes sometimes with medication

- In some severe cases, the vestibular system is disabled

	- Either chemically or by cutting the associated nerves

---

### The Vestibular Nerve

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

### Luckily, most causes of deafness don't affect the vestibular system

- ... and it's unusual that it has troubles

	- Save for a few diseases and ototoxic drugs

---

### We'll talk more about the causes of vestibular problems next time!

---

### Wrapping up

- The vestibular system helps us sense rotation, position, and linear forces

- The semicircular canals handle rotation

- The utricle and saccule handle position and linear acceleration

- The body uses more than just the vestibular system to do balance

- ... but we sure want the vestibular system to be working properly!


---

### For Next Time

- We'll think about the physiology we've discussed in application!
