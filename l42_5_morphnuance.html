# Morphological Nuances
### LIGN 42 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- Morphological Productivity

- Derivation and Inflection

---

## One Cool Note

---

### Signed language does a lot of Simultaneous Morphology

Thanks to [Dr. Bill Vicars](https://www.youtube.com/@aslu) for the following videos, and to Lexi Ricasata for collecting them.

---

### "I show you"

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/asl_showyou.gif"></img>

---

### "You show me"

<img class="r-stretch"  src="morphology/asl_showme.gif"></img>

---

### "He/she/they shows him/her/them"

<img class="r-stretch"  src="morphology/asl_show3p.gif"></img>

---

### So, don't think that morphemes need to be separated by time!

---

## Morphological Productivity

---

### How do you make a plural in English?

- List the morpheme(s) which let you say 'Now there are two of them'

---

### What's the plural of...

- wan
- bleeb
- gand
- rop
- fliss
- qwerp
- blen
- efla
- eebel

---

### We have many more options than we choose!

- What's up with that?

---

### Let's make some words

- **Bases**: hug, love, free, corrupt, sing, cute, meme

- **Prefixes**: re-, un-, pre-, de-, 

- **Suffixes**: -en, -ed, -er, -ee, -ize, -est

- *Tell me some combinations that work*

- *Tell me some combinations that **don't** work*

---

### Give me more words using...

- **-holic** from 'alcoholic'

- **cran-** from 'cranberry'

- **admi-** from 'admissions'

- **del-** from 'deleted'

---

### So we have...

- Affixes that exist in the language that don't get used for new words

- Affixes that exist in the language which only work with some words

- Evidence that although some things can be 'broken off' and still used, but others really can't.

---

### How do we describe when a morpheme *can* be used, or perhaps, when it *can't*

---

### Morphological Productivity

- The degree to which a grammatical process is in use by speakers

- Can we use this morphological pattern with a brand new base?

- Is the use of this morpheme *constrained*?  Or, *where can it apply?*

---

### In language, lots of things constrain productivity

- Part of speech (e.g. plural only attaches to nouns, '-ee' only attaches to verbs

- Sound structure (e.g. free+-ee sounds illegal)

- Even meaning (e.g. some affixes don't make any sense on some words)

---

### ... but many forms are *very* productive

- We can use them to create a word we've never heard, and *it just works*

	- "Uh, I need an adjective for 'simp'... uh... simpish?"

	- Everybody understands, nobody's confused, it feels right, and we move on
	
- **Productive morphology is *boring***

	- It just works, and we don't think twice

---

### Use an affix on a word where you've never used it before, creating something boring and normal

---

### ... but you can make morphological changes that aren't boring!

- They're understandable, but seem 'off', they 'raise eyebrows'

- They feel like *new words*, or like you've *coined a phrase* or are doing 'wordplay'

- They may even take a moment to figure out

- We can call these not productive, so much as **creative**

---

### Creative Words

- "Unbreak my heart, uncry these tears"

- "Can you stop linguisting and help me vacuum?"

- "Put down the haterade"

- "The problem was solved computeringly"

- "It looks like one of those awful low effort TikTok DIY Tutorials, so TikTacky"

---

N-now th-that that don't kill me

Can only make me stronger

I need you to hurry up now

'Cause I can't wait much longer

I know I got to be right now

'Cause I can't get much wronger

 --*Kanye West's 'Stronger'*

---

### In chat, give me a creative use of an existing affix!

---

### Creativity often builds new words

- Blends like 'frenemy' or 'mansplain' or 'covidiot' or 'situationship'

- Clipping words down like 'fam' or 'totes' or 'catching an L' or 'pog'

---

### Productivity and Creativity are a continuum

- It's hard to say when an affix is being used 'off label'

- Measurements of how 'innovative' a usage is are tough to do

- There's not a hard and fast line

- ... but we can usually tell when a combination is expected, or exceptional

---

### Give me...

- Some new words which you *instantly* understood and were boring

- Some new words which you *instantly* understood, and were **neat**

- Some new words which *took you a bit to understand*

---

### We'll think more about this idea this week!

- ... but we should think a bit more about one other phenomenon

---

## Derivational vs. Inflectional Morphology

---

### How many independent words are in each group?

- cat, penguin, bear, squirrel, dog

- cat, cats, cat's

- clean, red, moist, thrown

- white, whiter, whitest

- yeet, drag, suspect, eat, drink

- prove, proves, proved, proven, proving

- yeet, yeets, yote, youghten, yeeting

---

### Some morphology *creates new forms of existing words*

- "For this sentence or meaning, I need a different form, I'd better add something"

	- Making it a word plural, possessive, comparative, superlative
	
	- Marking verbal person (e.g. "I go" vs "He goes"), past tense, past and present participles
	
- *There is no doubt that these forms are 'the same word'*

---

### We call this 'inflectional Morphology'

- A morphological process which change the meaning of a word *in a given linguistic or grammatical context*

- cat, cats, cat's

- white, whiter, whitest

- yeet, yeets, yote, youghten, yeeting

---

### English: "Mom, can we stop and get inflectional morphology?"

- ### Mom: "We have inflectional Morphology at home"

---

### Inflectional morphology at home:

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/english_inflectional.jpg"> 

---

### Other languages use much more of it!

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/spanishverbs.jpg">

---

### Inflectional Morphology *modifies an existing word to suit the grammatical context*

- You get a new form of a word, but never a 'new word'

---

### Derivational morphology *creates new words*

- "I don't have a word for this, but I know a way I can make one"

- cat -> catty, catlike, cattish, catter, cathouse

- California -> Californian, Californiaish

- build -> rebuild, overbuild, underbuild, buildup, building, builder

---

### Let's hear some new words made from existing words!

---

### Adding Derivational affixes often changes characteristics of the words

- Not all words can take all affixes

	- Californiaishly

- They'll change the part of speech (e.g. from a noun to a verb)

- They'll change the meaning in less predictable ways

	- Inflectional morphology creates boring, predictable forms
	
	- Trucker, Hooker, Adapter, YouTuber, Steeler, Waiter

---

### Dictionaries care about derivational morphology

- Because meanings can be unpredictable, derivation tends to merit explanation and description

- Derivation is viewed as 'adding something new to the dictionary', generally speaking

	- ... although dictionaries don't always add all derived forms (e.g. un- or re-affixes are very predictable and might be skipped)
	
---

### Compounding is also a thing

- Compounding takes two existing free words and combines them for a new meaning

	- Laptop, backpack, cellphone, fireplace, lipstick
	
- Most Compounds have a 'head' which controls the part of speech and part of the meaning

	- Bookkeepers, Light Years (vs. a√±os luz), sidestepping, grad school

- Compounding acts like derivation

	- New words are created, and with unpredictable meanings

---

### Compounding meanings can be odd too

- Salad Dressing, Butt Dial, Booty Call, Big Mac, Blowhard, pushover, Hawkeye

- Substitutions feel **very** creative

	- Lapbottom?  Butt text?  Booty Skype?  Little Mac?  Eyestick?
	
---

### Let's look at some new words from your research

---

### So, we have derivational and inflectional morphology

- Derivational morphology is used to build new words

- Inflectional morphology changes their meanings in predictable ways in sentences

- The line between these can get blurry in some cases

	- ... and there's a lot of nuance and uncertainty as to how this actually works in the mind
	
---

### I think all of this works for other linguistic forms

- There are productive and creative uses of templates

- There are inflectional and derivational morphological processes

- Compounding is absolutely a thing in memes

	- ... and meme compounds have heads

---

## Important Definitions

**Morphological Productivity**: The ability of a morphological phenomenon to apply fluently and fluidly to new words.

---

**Creativity**: The application of morphological phenomena outside of the expected domain, resulting in something that feels 'new', unexpected, or like a 'brand new word'

---

**Derivational Morphology**: Attaching affixes that change the part of speech of the root, or change something important about the meaning

---

**Inflectional Morphology**:  Inflectional morphology predictably changes the meaning of the word in the sentence, but doesn't change the part of speech or meaning of the whole word in a deep way.

---

**Compounding**: A morphological process which comes from combining two existing free morphemes (not affixes) into a new word
