# Syntax for NLP

### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- Why do we need Syntax?

- Constituency and Constituency Testing

- Syntactic Hierarchy

- Syntax Trees

---

### "Jony chased Dieter"

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/fish_jonydieter.jpg"> 

---

### English uses word order to mark who did what to whom.

* "Will ate the veggie burger."

* "Jony chased Dieter"

* "Dieter chased Jony"

* "Will waved to Hagyeong"

* "Will insulted Michael Bay"

---

### ... and if we screw it up, that's a problem

- *Ate Will the Veggie Burger

- *Jony Dieter Chased

- *Will Burger Veggie Ate

---

### ... and then things move around

- "Will ate the veggie burger"

- "Will ate it"

- "Will ate what?"

- "What did Will eat?"

- *"What did Will eat it?"

---

### ... and things get ambiguous

- "Will likes ambiguity more than most people"

	- "Will likes ambiguity more than most people do"

	- "Will likes ambiguity more than he likes most people"

---

### Clearly, it's complicated

- ... and this is why we have...

---

# Syntax!

---

### Syntax is the study of the structure of sentences and utterances

- "What determines the order and arragement of words in sentences?"

- "What orderings and arrangements are grammatical in a language?"

- "How do we identify the meaning of words given their ordering?"

- "How does the ordering within a sentence change in contexts?"

---

### Let's start from the basics

---

# Constituency

---

### Syntactic Constituent

A group of words which 'go together' in the structure of the sentence

- *Constituents are always a continuous string of words*

	- No skipping words, these are continuous chunks!

---

### Constituents are chunks that, when split off, make sense

---

### We have intuitions about how things can be split

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_1.jpg">

---

### We know what breaks are "good"

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_2.jpg">

---

### ... and we know that even if other breaks are possible...

---

### They shouldn't always be done

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/kit_kat_cuts_4.jpg">

---

### Let's break me off a piece of that syntactic structure!

---

## Constituency Testing

---

### Constituency Testing

Using grammatical tests and manipulations to determine whether something is a valid constituent

- "Can this chunk be swapped for something else?"

- "Can this chunk form a standalone answer?"

---

## Constituency Test: Substitution

Can you replace that element of the sentence with a placeholder?

- Any time you can replace a chunk of sentence with something else, it's a constituent

---

### The indignant kitten eyed my veggie burger with disgust yesterday at dinner

- **He** eyed **it**

- The indignant kitten **did so**.

- The indignant kitten eyed **what** with digust **when**?

- The kitten eyed my veggie burger **how** yesterday at dinner?

- The **obligate carnivore** eyed my **dinner** with disgust **then**

- *There are other chunks we can't isolate like this*

	- [The indignant kitten eyed my]

---

### Good substitution testing words

- Wh-words (who, what, where, when, how, why)
	
- Pronouns (he, it, her, them, they, that)
	
- Adverbs of Place and Time (then, there)
	
- "Do so"

---

### If you can replace something with a placeholder, it's a constituent

- ... and if you are unable to, it's not a constituent!

---

### This is important for coreference in NLP?

- What does 'it' refer to in "The angry dog ate John's moldy sandwich.  It was disappointed."

- 'It' can replace 'the angry dog' or 'John's moldy sandwich' but not 'the dog ate'

- 'Which complete constituent of a prior sentence does this thing refer to?'

---

## Constituency Test: Standalone Answers

- A string of words that can be the answer to a WH question is a constituent

---

### Robert the Enchiladaholic thoughtlessly purchased a $1000 gift card to Chiquita's Mexican Restaurant last week.

- "Who bought the gift card?"

- "What did he buy?"

- "Where was the gift card to?"

- "When did he buy it?"

- "What did Robert do?"

- "How did he buy it?"

---

### If a chunk can serve as the standalone answer to a question, it's a constituent

- "What can a chunk that's a constitutent do?"

---

### This is crucial for question answering in NLP

- We want these systems to give us full chunks in response to questions

- "Who owns the crown jewels?"  "The Queen"

- "Which light is on, the living room or kitchen light?"  "The light is on."

- "What did Raul do on Friday?"  "He went."

---

### So, those are some ways that we evaluate constituency

- There are many more!

- Let's test it out

---

### What is *not* a constituent in "Michael and Karla founded an innovative new dermatology company last month"?

---

### What do we call these constituents?

- We name them after the *head* of the phrase

---

### The angry squirrel stole the mixed nuts from Walmart

- [The angry squirrel] - 'Noun Phrase' (NP), headed by a noun

- [stole the mixed nuts from Walmart] - 'Verb Phrase' (VP), headed by a verb

- [from Walmart] - 'Prepositional Phrase' (PP), headed by a preposition.

- [The angry squirrel stole the mixed nuts from Walmart] - The Sentence (S)

---

## Constituency is *really* important

- We seem to 'understand' it as language speakers

- Syntactic rules make constant reference to constituents

- We're pretty sure that whatever syntax is in the mind, constituency is a part of it

	- So, thinking about constituency is going to be constant
	
---

"OK, OK. We get it. Constituency is a thing."

- ### ... but where the heck does it come from?!

---

### Language is hierarchical

- Words combine into phrases/constituents

- Phrases combine to form bigger phrases.

- Phrases combine to form sentences.

- Phrase structure rules show how words/phrases combine to form larger phrases/sentences.

---

### We can't treat sentences as 'flat' and find constituency

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrelflat.jpg">

---

### But if we think about it hierarchically...

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrel.jpg">

- ### BOOM!  Constituency.

---

### We need to go deeper...

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrelfull.jpg">

---

### Or maybe...

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_angrysquirrelfullalt.jpg">

---

### Syntax Trees

- A representation of the hierarchical structure of sentences, capturing constituency.

- Derived from a finite set of rules which dictate the ordering of components


---

### I ate.

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_iate.jpg">

---

### I see you.

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_iseeyou.jpg">

---

### The dog chased the cat

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_dogchased.jpg">

---

### I saw the big, sweet dogs from La Jolla with fleas

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_dogs_long.jpg">

---

### Trees express syntactic structure independent of specific words

<img class="small" src="diagrams/tree_dogchased.jpg"><img class="small" src="diagrams/tree_dogchased_alt.jpg">

---

### Linguists build these trees using lists of 'phrase structure rules'.

- This constituent is made up of these subparts

- S -> NP VP

- NP -> DET N'

- N' -> N

- VP -> V NP

- ... and many more

---

### Olivier ran a discussion section Friday

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_101sc_olivierran.jpg">

---

### The stuffed kittens plotted revenge in an empty quiet apartment

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_101sc_kittens.jpg">

---

### Her incessant desire for enchiladas consumed her every waking thought

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_101sc_enchiladas.jpg">


---


<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_complementizercake.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/tree_speakerproved.jpg">

---

### This is a *generative* way of doing syntax

- Good rules can generate all of the grammatical and 'good' forms

	- ... while generating none of the ungrammatical, 'bad' forms

- This is great for linguistics and the idea of grammar

	- ... and makes some parts of the syntactic process much easier
	
---

### ... but there's a LOT of machinery here

- Which all depends on having a smoothly functioning grammar

- ... and creates a lot of structure, which may not all be needed

- So we'll talk about the approach more commonly used in NLP soon!

---

### Wrapping up

- We know that languages can use word order to understand what went on

- We know that there's more to it than ordering

- We know that constituents of sentences are a thing

	- ... and that they're derived from hierarchy in sentences

- We can read tree diagrams to understand the nature of that hierarchy

---

### Next time

- We'll dive into POS tagging and teaching computers to find lexical categories
