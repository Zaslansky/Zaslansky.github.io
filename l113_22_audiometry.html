# Audiometry

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### We've now talked about 'objective' hearing tests

- Otoscopy, Tympanometry, Acoustic Reflex Testing, OAEs, and ABR Testing

- Let's bring the human element back

---

### Audiometry characterizes how effectively people are able to hear sounds

- How well you can hear sounds at different frequencies and amplitudes

	- Pure tone audiometry

- How well you can hear speech at different amplitudes

	- Speech Audiometry

- Both test your ability to use your hearing

	- These are 'subjective' tests

---

### Today's Plan

- Audiometric Testing Equipment

- Pure-tone Audiometry

- Speech Audiometry

- Reading an audiogram

---

## Audiometric Testing Equipment

---

### Sound Booth

<img class="r-stretch

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_soundbooth.jpg">

---

### Sound Booths are crucial

- Lowers the 'noise floor'

- The signals being presented will have no 'competition'

- You can only test sounds > RoomNoise - AttenuationOfHeadphones

- **Don't trust the low end of a test done in a noisy booth!**

---

### Audiometer

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_audiometerMA25.jpg">

---

### Basic Audiometer Functions

- Adjust the amplitude of the tone

- Adjust the frequency of the tone

- Send the tone

---

### Audiometers can be basic or complex

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_audiometer_astera.jpg">

---

### Complex Audiometer Functions

- Talk and listen to the patient inside the booth

- Masking noise

- Choice of transducers

- Choice of stimulus type

    - Speech vs. Puretone vs. Warble Tone vs. Pulse Tone

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_audiometer_detail.jpg">

---

### Software-based Audiometry

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_audiometer_pcbased.jpg">

---

### Transducers

- Audiologists refer to 'headphones' as transducers

- These turn output from the audiometry box into sound

- Different transducers for different goals

- Audiological transducers are very 'flat' by design

    - They produce all relevant frequencies at the same levels

---

### Supraural Transducers

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_supraaural.jpg">

---

### In-Ear Transducers

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_insertearphones.jpg">

---

### High-Frequency Headphones

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_ehf_headphones.jpg">

---

### Bone Conduction

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_boneconduction.jpg">

---

### Sound Field

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_soundfield.jpg">

- Generally not advised!

---

### Calibration is key!

- 60 dB in software is meaningless when transducers and outputs vary

- Professional calibration guarantees that the 60dB setting generates 60dB tones

    - Each transducer type must be calibrated separately

    - Calibration should be done yearly, ~$100 USD

- Without calibration, all you know is relative frequency results

- This is why [online or DIY tests](https://hearingtest.online/) aren't very reliable!

---

## Pure-tone Audiometry

---

### Pure-tone audiometry

- Measures the amplitude required to hear a "pure tone" at a variety of frequencies.

    - Pure tones are simple waves, not complex

- "Press the button when you hear a beep"

---

### Types of Tones

- Pure Tones

    - Just a vanilla sine wave at Frequency f

- Warble Tones

    - 'Frequency modulated' tones, where the sound goes between (e.g.) f +/- 5% at 5 Hz

- Pulsed Tones

    - 'Amplitude pulsed' tones, where the puretone is played (e.g.) for 200ms, then off, then played...

- [Pulsed Tones and Warble Tones are more easily distinguished from tinnitus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5831060/)'

    - They also avoid 'standing waves' when played with speakers

- Pick one and use it, thresholds aren't comparable across tone types

---

### Examples (800 Hz)

Pure: <audio controls src="hearing/800pure.wav">

Pulsed (200ms): <audio controls src="hearing/800pulse.wav">

Warble (3 Hz): <audio controls src="hearing/800warble.wav">

---


### The goal is to establish a 'threshold'

- "What is the lowest amplitude sound this patient can hear by frequency?"

- Thresholds are usually taken between 250-8000Hz

- The end result is an *audiogram*

---

### The procedure

- Play a tone at a given frequency

- Wait for participant response

- If they hear it, go quieter

- If they don't, go louder

- *... but you need to make sure they're not cheating!*

---

### Patients will give false responses!

- False positives are responses when no tone is audible

- False negatives are failures to respond to a tone they can hear

---

### Precautions to avoid biased tests

- Randomly timing your presses to avoid guessing

- Facing the patient away from you

- Using a testing paradigm to arrive at the proper measurement

- Not allowing patients to measure their own hearing

    - Again, this is why online tests aren't great

---

### '5 Down 10 Up' Paradigm

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_5down10up.jpg">

---

### The threshold is determined by a 50% response rate

- Patients should respond at least 50% of the time to that tone for that to 'count'

---

### This creates an 'audiogram'

- Audiograms show the quietest tone reliably responded to across frequencies

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_2016_left.jpg">

---

### You'll likely want to test bone conduction as well as air conduction!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/aud_bcvsac.jpg">

---

### You'll want to use masking

- Contralateral masking helps prevent one ear from 'helping' the other

    - If HL exceeds interaural attenuation

- See the 'Masking' video for details there

- Or Chapter 9 in your textbook

---

### You might test higher frequencies too!

- High frequency audiograms go above 8000 Hz

- This requires more specialized equipment

- Useful for monitoring some kinds of ototoxic drugs and [detecting loss early](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22122956)

- Also [has some generalized benefits](https://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/Fulltext/2017/03000/Benefits_of_Extended_High_Frequency_Audiometry_for.8.aspx)

---

### We're going to stop here with pure tones!

- The book goes into more details about testing kids, procedures, and other complexities!

- Chapter 6 is your friend!

---

## Speech Audiometry

---

### Pure tones capture one aspect of hearing

- Raw ability to hear frequencies

- ... but often, poor speech intelligibility is the biggest complaint

- **Why not test speech perception directly?**

---

### Speech Audiometry has three aspects

- How loud does speech need to be for them to hear *that* speech is being produced?

    - The 'Speech Detection Threshold' (SDT)

- How loud does speech need to be to be understandable?

    - The 'Speech Recognition Threshold' (SRT)

- How accurately are they recognizing the words?

    - The 'Word Recognition Score' (WRS)

---

### Speech Audiometry Procedure

- Read words aloud with the level limited to certain amplitudes

- Ask the participant to repeat the words back

- Score...

    - Whether they heard the word (SDT)

    - Whether they accurately heard the word (SRT)

    - Individual Phoneme Errors (WRS)

- Repeat the task with masking noise to check perception in noise

---

### Not all words are equally understandable

- Attempting to use words which are familiar to everybody

    - [Or are they?](https://www.audiology.org/news/impending-spondee-crisis-audiology-age-millennial)

- Audiologists use monosyllables and "spondees", words with two stressed syllables

---

### Sample Audiology Spondees

- [Words from the NU-6 Listing](https://pubs.asha.org/doi/10.1044/jshd.4003.388): sidewalk, birthday, cupcake, airplane, railroad, baseball, playground, cowboy, sunset, hotdog, outside... 

- [A new list](https://www.audiology.org/news/impending-spondee-crisis-audiology-age-millennial): smartphone, hashtag, upload, bikeshare, cashcow, laptop, iPad, flashmob, backpack, deadbeat, bandwidth, roadrage...

---

### Testing follows a fixed procedure

- This is complicated, and there are many moving parts

- You can use masking if the required level exceeds interaural attenuation

- You can also do recognition in noise to get a better sense of in-the-world recogition

- These are detailed in Chapter 8

---

### Reported Results

- Generally you'll report SDT and SRT in dB

- You'll report maximum "PB" (phonetically balanced word recognition) and associated level for SRT

- More detailed tests give more detailed results

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_speech.jpg">

---

### These audiometric data give great information

- What is the nature, severity, and distribution of hearing loss?

- What of this loss is present in bone conduction as well?

- How does this loss affect their ability to hear speech?

---

### All of this is recorded and reported in the audiogram


<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_NOV2019.jpg">

---

## Reading Audiograms

---

### Audiograms give us data about thresholds, by frequency, with and without masking

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_blank.jpg">

---

### Looking at an audiogram gives us information about hearing loss

- We know what frequencies and amplitudes exist in the world

- We see the difference between masked and unmasked

- Sounds which are 'above the line' are not going to be audible

- This gives rise to...

### The Speech Banana

<img src="hearing/speech_banana.jpg"> 

---

### Audiograms can then be interpreted for diagnostic purposes

- ... and interpreting the audiogram is a skill we'll be working on

- Often, audiograms (with the other tests we've discussed) provide key diagnostic information

- **Reading Chapter 7 is important!**

---

### Let's look at a sample audiogram

---

### Wrapping up

- Audiometric Testing Equipment is specialized and expensive

- Puretone Audiometry gives us absolute thresholds for hearing by frequency

- Speech Audiometry gives us a better sense of how speech is perceived

- Audiograms give us all the information we need in one convenient place
