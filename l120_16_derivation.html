## A quick note!

- I'm trying new presentation software

- Here goes nothing!

- Only a PDF will be available for today's lecture

## Since Will's battling some microbe or another

- Please give your answers to the clicker questions in the discussion thread on Canvas titled 'Clicker and Discussion Questions for Monday May 5th'

# Derivation vs. Compounding

## Compounding

- The combination of two free morphemes to produce a new lexeme

- Backpack, Throughput, Facebook, Smalltalk, Sleepwalk

## Derivation combines a bound morpheme with a free one

- Back-pack vs. Pack-er, Small-talk vs. Talk-ative, sleep-walk vs. sleep-y-ness

## We'll talk about compounding later on this quarter

- ... but today we'll focus on other kinds of Derivation

- Hope this wasn't a letdown

# Derivation by Category Change

## Derivation *often* changes the lexical category of words

- "Hmm, I have this verbal meaning, but I need it as an adjective"

## A note on de-

- When derivation changes the lexical category, we mark that shift with de-

- 'Deverbal' forms were verbs ('extraction')

- 'Denominal' forms were nouns ('to chauffer')

## Nominal Derivations

## A note on 'Nominal'

- "Nominal" means "Pertaining to nouns"

    - Mostly because "Nouny" isn't a thing

- (This is a derivational suffix!)


## Nominalization

- Changing lexical categories to nouns

## Some deadjectival Nouns

- **De-Adjectival Quality Nouns**: Thoroughness, Grandiosity

- **Person Nouns**: Smarty, Dummy, Cutie

- **DeState Nouns:** Happiness, Sadness, Nerdiness

## Some deverbal Nouns

- Agent Nominalization

    - Infector, Driver, Computer, Gardener

- Patient Nominalizations

    - Detainee, Retiree, Defenestratee

- Instrument Nominalization (Action to Instrument)

    - Grinder, Planer, Shooter, Retainer

- Product Nominalization (Action to Product)

    - Scratch, Break, Purchase, Convert

- Abstract Nominalization

    - Deliverance, Reflectance, Hydration

## The meanings can be unpredictable

- "John works at Art of Espresso. He's a coffee grinder."

- "Mark has retired three times now. He's a serial retirer."

- "I just downloaded a new YouTube app.  It's a great YouTuber."

- "Mark builds armor, he's an armorer.  Steven builds hooks, he's a ..."

## There are big holes in these paradigms!

\begin{table}[]
\small
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
                 & \textbf{Conv.} & \textbf{Stress} & \textbf{-er} & \textbf{-ee} \\
\textbf{infect}  & in'fect        & 'infect         & infector     & infectee     \\
\textbf{retire}  & re'tire        & 'retire         & retirerer    & retiree      \\
\textbf{detain}  & de'tain        & 'detain         & detainer     & detainee     \\
\textbf{grind}   & grind          & N/A             & grinder      & grindee      \\
\textbf{scratch} & scratch        & N/A             & scratcher    & scratchee    \\
\textbf{produce} & pro'duce       & 'produce        & producer     & producee    
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Adjectival Derivations

## Some Adjective Derivations

- **Denominal Adjectives**

    - Waterless, Computational, Linguistic, Academic, Recreational, Shoe-al?

- **Deverbal Adjectives**

    - Pronounceable, Readable, Edible, Typeable

## Verbal Derivations

- **Resultatives**

    - Victimize, Summarize, Theorize

## Verbal Derivations Continued

- **Tricky Denominals**

    - Glorify, Deify, Anodize

- **Deadjectival Verbs**

    - Flatten, Smoothen, Finalize, Clarify, Sharpen, Enrich

## Adverbial Derivations

- Not all adverbs are derived

    - e.g. tomorrow, then, only

- Some are denominal

    - e.g. width-wise, step-wise, homeward, schoolward

- Deadjectival is very common

    - e.g. quickly, dumbly, amazedly, slowly
    
## The word 'dethroner' is...

 A - Deverbal

 B - Denominal

 C - Deadjectival 

 D - Deadverbial

 E - Dethronal

**Click in!**

## The word 'computering' is...

 A - Deverbal

 B - Denominal

 C - Deadjectival 

 D - Deadverbial

 E - Dethronal

**Click in!**

## ... but not all derivation involves changes in lexical categories

# Derivations within a lexical category

## Deriving Nouns from Nouns

- **Status Nouns** 

    - adulthood, childhood, studenthood, cathood 

- **Inhabitant Nouns** 

    - Californian, Coloradan, German, Massachusettian?

- **Gendered Nouns** 

    - Heir -> Heiress, Steward -> Stewardess

## Deriving Adjectives from other adjectives

- **Opposites**

    - unhealthy, unwell, unattractive, unpopular

- **Intensives**

    - Cute, Ubercute, Supercute, Megacute, Cuteacular

- **Attenuatives**

    - Nice, Niceish, Good-to-fair

## Deriving Verbs from other verbs

- **Repetitive Verbs**

    - remake, redo, recast

- **Reversive Verbs**

    - unmake, undo, uncast, unbreak

- **Preposition-containing Verbs**

    - undercut, encircle, uplift, overkill

## There are many, many more derivational processes

- ... with new ones arriving every day!

# New Derivational Affixes

## New affixes can enter the language!

- Techno- (from 'Technology')

    - Techno-geek, Technophile, Technofetishist

- Cyber- (from 'Cybernetics')

    - Cyber, Cybergoth, Cybersecurity, Cyberattack, Cyberterrorism

- i-

    - iMac, iBook, iPhone, iOS, iPad, iClicker, iRepair, iFixIt

- -gate

    - Watergate, Monicagate, Gamergate, Emailgate, Russiagate, Bridgegate

# Let's find some affixes!

## In small groups...

- Describe as many derivational affixes as you can, providing:

    - The affix (its form)
    
    - Its meaning or function
    
    - Three words it *can* attach to
    
    - Three words it *cannot* attach to

## Wrapping Up

- Derivational morphology often changes lexical categories

- There are within-category derivations

- New derivational affixes do happen

- Reanalysis is another common source of these affixes

## For Next Time

- Matt's going to talk about his work

- Then, we'll be productive
