# Hearing Aids 

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- What does a hearing aid do?

- Signal Processing in Hearing Aids

- Hearing aid types

- Hearing aid fitting

- When don't hearing aids work?

- Addressing lingering questions from the course so far

---

## CAPEs

---

## What does a hearing aid do?

---

### Hearing Aids amplify the input signal!

- It can be uniform throughout the frequency domain, or targeted

- A microphone picks up on the signal

- It's converted to digital form and processed

- It's played back into the ear canal in louder (potentially modified) form

---

### Hearing Aids turn incoming acoustic signals into louder acoustic signals 

- Sometimes with some intermediate processing

- ... and everything happens **before** the tympanic membrane

---

### Different hearing aid types have different advantages

- Cosmetic advantages

	- In ear vs. Behind Ear vs. In-Canal

	- This is also a realm for middle-ear implants!

- Degree of amplification

	- BTE is usually able to offer greater amplification than CIC, e.g.

- Vulnerability to ear canal change

	- Kids don't want in-ear aids for changing ears

- Do you want any sound to pass through at all?

	- If you're just amplifying part of the spectrum, let natural hearing work too!

---

### There's a lot more to this choice

- ... but your book goes into details!

- And you'll figure this out as you go about...

---

## Fitting Hearing Aids

---

### We're not getting too deep into fitting!

- Hearing aid fitting is a whole subdiscipline

- There are thousands of variants and types

- Every company has their own secret sauces and marketing hype

	- The products are roughly equivalent in quality within a price range

- We're going to talk about the basic concepts

	- ... and leave the rest to the future!

---

### How are hearing aids fitted?

- Check the hearing

- Figure out the pain points for the patient

- Select the best choice given the constraints

- Instruct the patient on their use

- Tune them as needed

---

### The focus needs to be on patient outcomes!

- If the hearing aid isn't helping where they need help, it's not doing any good!

- Good fitting may require multiple tuning sessions

	- Adjusting frequency responses

	- Adjusting filtering settings

	- Adjusting amplification strength

- The best hearing aid in the world doesn't do anything on the nightstand!

---

### People are often reluctant to use Hearing Aids

- Partly due to stigma

- Partly due to poor prior experiences, or family experiences

- Partly due to the complexity involved

- Often due to cost

	- Which pushes people towards...

---

## Hearing Amplifiers and PSAPs

---

### Not all 'hearing aids' are hearing aids

- There exists a shadowy world of 'hearing amplifiers' or 'personal sound amplification products' (PSAPs)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hearing_amplifiers.png">

---

### These are one-size-fits-all

- 'Turn the screw for more volume in all frequencies'

- 'Use different tips for different ears'

- 'We made an Airpod with a microphone which plays things louder'

- Meant to be cheap, not comfortable

---

### This line is about to get blurry

- Real Hearing Aids can now be sold Over-The-Counter in the US

	- No audiologist is needed

- Watch for big companies to enter the space with 'smart hearing aids'

- Ask how smart they are!

	- ... and whether they're adapting to the person's hearing loss at all

---

### Challenges for Over-the-Counter Products

- Characterizing the level and nature of the hearing loss

- Tuning the devices to patient needs

- Overamplification

- One-size-fits-all form factors

- Ongoing support and maintenance

- Loss of screening for other disorders

	- Wax buildup? Choleasteatoma? Acoustic Neuroma?

---

## When *don't* hearing aids work?

---

### Hearing aids offer great outcomes for lots of folks!

- Amplification can be a great help for many

- Loss of hearing can be very difficult for folks who've always had it!

- ... but hearing aids aren't always enough!

---

### Even when they work, it's not perfect hearing!

- With loss of OHCs, the sound may be perceptible, but it won't be as clean!

	- Frequency specificity is lost

- "Notched" loss, where some frequencies are missing, won't be fixed here

- Dynamic range losses mean that distortion is inevitable

- **Take care of your ears!  Technology cannot save you!**

---

### Hearing Aids make use of the existing auditory physiology

- "Let's make sounds loud enough that they'll pick it up!"

---

### Hearing aids don't work with profound conductive loss

- Then you'll want to use bone conduction

	- Bone conduction Hearing aids

	- Bone anchored implants

- Or maybe a middle-ear implant!

	- Which interfaces directly with the ossicles

---

### None of these options work when there's no cochlear transduction

- If the person can't turn sound into nerve impulses, amplification isn't the problem!

- This can also happen if the loss is so profound that sufficient amplification isn't possible

- In these cases, patients might consider a surgical option

---

## Lingering Questions? Muddy points?

---

### Wrapping up

- Hearing aids amplify signals moving into the middle ear

- They have many different kinds of on-board processing

- They can also incorporate other sources of sound

- Different form factors make for different experiences

- Fitting is complicated

- Hearing aids don't always work!

---

### Next Time

The surgical option!
