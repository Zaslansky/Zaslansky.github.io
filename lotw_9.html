# Turkic and Semitic Languages
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### The review sheet for the midterm is online!

* One of the long-answer questions *will be on the test*!

	* I eliminated two last night.  It's just 6 now.

---

## Today's Agenda

* Morphological Type

	* Isolating vs. Synthetic

	* Agglutinating vs. Fusional

* Turkic Languages!

* Semitic Languages!

---

## Morphological Type

---

### Morphology

The study of how words are put together

---

### Morphological Type

A means of categorizing how languages put words together

---

We care about two "dimensions":

* ***Do words have lots of morphemes or few?***

* ***If they have multiple morphemes, do they blend together, or are they easy to pick apart?***

---

### Do words have lots of morphemes or few?

* If words have few morphemes (like English or Chinese), they're "isolating"

* If they have many (like Spanish or German), they're "synthetic"

	* Languages where whole sentences are single words are sometimes called "polysynthetic"

---

I did see the cat on the street, he's cute.

1sg did see DEF cat on DEF street 3sg-be.3sg cute.

* Only one morpheme in most words! ***This is Isolating!***

---

*Esta escribiéndomelo*

be.3sg write-GER-1sg.DAT-3sg.MASC

'He/she is writing it to me.'

* Lots of morphemes per word! ***This is Synthetic!***

---

<lang>Wichita</lang><br><ldata>Caddoan - Oklahoma</ldata>

Kiyakiicíwa:cé:hirʔasʔirhawi

‘There was the big buffalo lying there.’

* Uh... yeah. ***This is polysynthetic!***

---

### In a synthetic language, do the morphemes blend together, or are they easy to pick apart?

* If they're glued together loosely, it's "agglutinating"

* If they merge inseparably, it's "fusional".

---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata> 

<img src="lotwimg/agglutinatingturkish.png"> 

* Those add together cleanly, and pick back apart.  We're ***agglutinating***!

Durmiéramos

Durmiéramos

Sleep.2pl.SUBJ.PAST.IMPERFECT

* Whoa.  All that is one morpheme?  No easy lines?  ***Fusion*** drives engaged!

---

## Why does Robin Thicke prefer agglutinating languages?

* ### Because he hates blurred lines.

	* (Not because he's creepy and misogynistic)

---

### Both "agglutinating" and "fusional" are types of "synthetic"

* Neither term applies to highly isolating languages

	* "How do you string together morphemes in languages which don't string morphemes together?"

---


### It's always a continuum

* English is isolating, but Mandarin is *more* isolating

	* Same with Synthetic: Nobody's besting Wichita, but we don't hold it against them.

* Most languages do *some* fusion and *some* agglutination

	* We call a language fusional or agglutinating when it becomes a habit

### Morphological Type - Review!

* If a language has few morphemes per word, it's *isolating*

* If the language has multiple morphemes per word, it's *synthetic*

* If a synthetic language has easy-to-pick-apart morphemes, it's *agglutinating*

* If a synthetic language has blended or combined morphemes, it's *fusional*

# Turkic Languages!

---

## They're not just Turkish!

---

### Turkic

* Turkic is one of the top-level language families

	* (Although we're thinking it's grouped with Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, Japonic under *Altaic*)

* ~35 Turkic languages, depending where you draw the line

* Over 200 million speakers of Turkic

	* Turkish has the most speakers, followed by Azeri, Uzbek, Kazakh, and Uyghur

---

### Features of Turkic Languages

* Agglutinative Morphology

* SOV order

* *No* grammatical gender

* Evidentials!

* Vowel Harmony!

---

### Aggultinative Morphology

Been there, done that...

---

### Got the Agglutinating T-Shirt!

<img src="lotwimg/agglutinating_shirt.jpg">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### (as opposed to the fusional t-shirt)

<img src="lotwimg/fusional_shirt.jpg">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### SOV Order!

---

### *No* grammatical gender at all!

* (Unlike the surrounding languages)

---

### Evidentiality Marking

Describes the speaker's knowledge of the topic under discussion

---

### There are different ways to code Evidentiality

* Inferentiality ("I know it" vs. "I inferred it")

	* (This is what the Turkic languages are doing)

* Evidentiality (direct vs. circumstantial vs. hearsay vs. assumption)

	* (Some languages have a different morpheme for each)
---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata>

* 'gel-di'	"He came"	   	

* 'gel-miş'	"He came, to the best of my knowledge"

---

### Vowel Harmony

When vowels change to match the other vowels in the word

---

### Tukish has back-front vowel harmony

* This means that vowels in a word must be either *all back* or *all front*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/turkishvowels.png">
  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  
---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata> 

*Türkiye’dir* - ‘it is Turkey’

* *kapidir* - ‘it is the door’

* *gündür* - ‘it is day’

* *paltodur* -‘it is the coat’

* *The vowel in the last syllable changes depending on the other vowels!*

# Semitic Languages!

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/semiticmap.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/semiticfamily.png"> 

---

### Semitic Languages

* Maybe top-level, maybe "Afroasiatic"

* Widely spoken (~475 million speakers!)

---

### Semitic Languages

* Arabic (all dialects) - 300 million speakers

* Amharic (Ethiopia) - 21 million

* Hebrew (Israel) - 7 million

* Tigrinya (Ethiopia) - 6.5 million

* Aramaic (Middle East) - 550,000

---

### Features of Semitic

* Case

* Emphatic Consonants

* Templatic Morphology

---

### Case

Semitic languages usually have NOM, ACC, and Genitive

---

### Emphatic Consonants

Consonants produced with a secondary *pharyngeal* articulation in the back of the mouth

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection.png"> 

---

*"I'm not even going to try and pronounce these"* - Will 

<img class="big" src="humorimg/cheese_fail.jpg">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

<lang>Arabic</lang><br><ldata>Semitic - All over</ldata> 

تين (figs) - طين (mud)

سور (fence) - صور (Tyre, city in Lebanon)

ذل (humiliation) - ظل (shadow)

(or watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIVLfdRxdeI))

---

## Templatic Morphology!

---

### Templatic Morphology

Words are formed by inserting and replacing sounds into different parts of the word

---

<lang>Arabic</lang><br><ldata>Semitic - All over</ldata> 

<img src="lotwimg/template1.png">

k_t_b = "book"

---

<lang>Arabic</lang><br><ldata>Semitic - All over</ldata> 

<img src="lotwimg/template2.png">

k_t_v = "write"

---

### Templatic Morphology

* Word roots are "incomplete", and are turned into words by filling in the blanks

* Words sharing a set of consonants (root) will have similar meanings

* All Semitic languages use templatic morphology

	* If you find a language doing this, it's likely Semitic

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 

You come upon a language which displays Templatic Morphology.  'Jeleb' means "Duck".  'Jalob' means "To quack".  'Julab' likely means...

a) Paper Towel 
b) Communism
c) Goose
d) Basket
e) Sunglasses

---

So, about those Semitic Languages...

---

### Hebrew

* Died as a spoken language in 1st to 4th Centuries CE

* Survived only as a liturgical language in Judaism

* Resurrected (rebuilt, reconstructed) in the 19th Century

* Now has around 7 million speakers

	* One of Israel's official languages

	* (World's most popular ConLang?)

* Hebrew has a particularly famous speaker...

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/borat.png">

* Borat's "Kazakh" is actually Hebrew 

---

... and maybe Jesus

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/jesus.jpg"> 

<small>(Hebrew was a holy language, so although Jesus likely *knew* Hebrew, he likely seldom spoke it)</small>   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
---

### Arabic

* Around 300 million speakers around the world

* Many different dialects

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/arabicdialects.png"> 

---

### Arabic

Around 300 million speakers around the world

Many different dialects

* All are written using the Arabic script

	* Written Right-to-left

---

**English**

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

**Arabic**

يولد جميع الناس أحراراً متساوين في الكرامة والحقوق، وقد وهبوا عقلاً وضميراً وعليهم أن يعامل بعضهم بعضاً بروح الإخاء.1

---

### Arabic too has a particularly well known speaker

---

### The Prophet Muhammad spoke Arabic

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/quran.jpg">

* ... and Arabic is the language of the Quran

---

<lang>Aramaic</lang><br><ldata>Semitic - Ethiopia</ldata>

* Around since ~500 BCE 

	* Used by the Neo-Assyrians, Neo-Babylonians, Achaemenids

* Language of the books of Daniel and Ezra

* Used in the Dead Sea Scrolls (although Jewish Aramaic is different)

* Modern Aramaic is still spoken (although it's endangered)

* Aramaic has a particularly famous speaker

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/jesus.jpg"> 

<small>(Although he probably also spoke Hebrew, Koine Greek, and maybe Latin)</small>   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### "The Passion of the Christ"

* Mel Gibson's 2004 "the Passion of the Christ" is done mostly in "Aramaic"

* This is reconstructed old Aramaic, with blanks filled in from 4th Century Aramaic

	* So, Jesus *might* understand what they were saying in that movie

---

... and a less well-known Semitic language!

---

<lang>Amharic</lang><br><ldata>Semitic - Ethiopia</ldata> 

<iframe data-autoplay width="840" height="690" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/512Y81UG71E"></iframe> 

---

### Amharic

* Spoken by 25 million people in Ethiopia

* Uses ejectives instead of emphatic consonants

* Considered a sacred language by Rastafarians

	* 'Ras' is an Amharic Honorific, and 'Tafari' is the founder's born name

* It has an awesome writing system too!

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/amharic_script.jpg"> 

---

### Wrapping up!

* We classify languages by morphological type

	* Isolating vs. Synthetic

	* Agglutinating vs. Fusional

* Turkic Languages are awesome

	* Know their features

* Semitic Languages are also awesome

	* Know their features, too!
