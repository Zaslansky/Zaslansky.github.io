### A Mysterious Epenthesis

---

# Sonority

### Will Styler - LIGN 111

---

### We've already talked about Syllables

![](diagrams/syllable.jpg)

---

### We've seen lots of restrictions on what can go inside them

- "No complex codas"

- "CVC only"

- "Only certain codas"

- "CV, damnit!"

---

### Today, we'll talk about one last kind of restriction

---

### Why is [kɹ] a legal onset in English, but *[ɹk] isn’t?

- Why [pl], but not [lp]?

- [sl], but not [ls]?

- [sn], but not [ns]?

---

### There's more to this than just "CVC"

---

# Sonority

---

## Sonority Hierarchy

A language-specific ranking of sounds which determines the legality of onsets and codas

---

### Syllables have an expected sonority pattern

![](diagrams/sonority_slope.jpg)

---

## The more sonorous a segment, the closer it should live to the nucleus!

---

### Languages Rank Segments in terms of their sonority

In English...

- Glides > /r/ > /l/ > Nasals > Voiced Fricatives > Voiced Stops/Voiceless Fricatives > Voiceless Stops

---

### So, we can look at the hierarchy to determine syllable legality!

---

### Cat

### Smell

### Malt

---

### Plump

---

### Creams

![](diagrams/sonority_creams.jpg)

---

### ... but ...

---

### Msell

---

### Matl

---

### Lpupm

![](diagrams/sonority_lpupm.jpg)

---

### Rceasm

![](diagrams/sonority_rceasm.jpg)

---

### Phonetics?  In my phonology?

---

### Mind you, there's more to life than Sonority

---

### Kmalp

![](diagrams/sonority_kmalp.jpg)

---

### Sticks

![](diagrams/sonority_sticks.jpg)

---

### Final coronal obstruents are special in English

- [s d t θ z] can combine with prior stops or fricatives

- ... and can be the third element in the coda

---

![](diagrams/syll_strengths.jpg)

---

### The Appendix

- This issue has led some to propose an additional element of the syllable, the 'appendix'

- Not part of the onset, coda, or rhyme, but attaches directly to the syllable node

---

![](diagrams/syll_strengths_appendix.jpg)

---

### ... but that's beside the point!

- (and beside the syllable :D)

---

### Sonority is useful!

- It helps explain some odd patterns

- It lets us cope when CCV is *sometimes* OK

- It gives us the tools we need for our dataset
