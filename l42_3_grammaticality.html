# On Grammaticality in Language and Memes
### LIGN 42 - Will Styler

---

### Linguists, my apologies

- You've learned some of this before

- Please help me guide the conversation, and tell us what you've learned

---

## Grammaticality Examples

- A "This is perfectly fine"
- E "This is not acceptable in any way"

---

### Example Group A

- 1: "Will was surprised that people signed up for this class."

- 2: "A loss meme, Priya was judged for posting."

- 3: "Alonso liked all the pupusas he tried them"

- 4: "Maria walk to a parks on Weekend."

- 5: "Drake funny laughed meme Murray the at."

- 6: "Ïù¥Í≤ÉÏùÄ Ïò¨Î∞îÎ•∏ ÏòÅÏñ¥Í∞Ä ÏïÑÎãôÎãàÎã§"

---

### These show differences in **descriptive grammaticality**

- They get progressively harder to understand

- They are not 'wrong' so much as 'broken'

- These don't follow rules that everybody follows

---

## Let's see some *descriptively* ungrammatical sentences

---

### Example Group B

- 1: There looks to be a problem outside

- 2: There sounds to be somebody in there

- 3: There smells to be something rotten in there

- 4: There feels to be something in the bag

- 5: There tastes to be an issue with the cookies

- 6: "Would you like fish and chips?" "Yes, I'll do those."

---

### These examples show *gradience*

- Grammaticality isn't on or off, there can be levels

---

## Let's see hear some differently interesting sentences

---

### Example Group C

- 1: "Me and my friend walked over to Geisel"

- 2: "This class is a strange thing to start your linguistics education with."

- 3: "Will loves to defiantly make students cringe when teaching."

- 4: "Irregardless of what buttons were pressed; my oven would'nt turn on."

- 5: "The cat's were sleeping on you're couch over their."

- 6: "ur rly gon disliek dis last sntce if ur a eng prof!! ü§£"

---

### These show differences in **prescriptive grammaticality**

- They're all quite understandable, but they break 'rules'

	- Spelling conventions
	
	- 'Never end a sentence with a preposition'
	
	- 'irregardless isn't a word'
	
- These aren't rules which 'matter' for understanding as in group A

	- They're social rules
	
---

### Example Group D

---

### Imagine you're teaching a class

- You've given a student a B+, and they decide to engage in some grade-grubbing

	- üòñ
	
- You receive the following email...

---

- 1: "Professor, would it maybe be possible for you to perhaps reconsider my grade on my final paper?"

- 2: "Will, can you please change my grade on the final?  It seems a bit lower than I deserved."

- 3: "dude we both know my final grade was way low, could you change it?"

- 4: "hey prof change mah final proj grade plz.  shiz was wayyyyyy too low dawg."

- 5: "pls pls pls change my final grade ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ fr im so so sad i got an a-"

---

### These are differences in **register**

- There are some *prescriptive* spelling rules broken here, but all are again understandable

- Some of these sentences are perfectly well formed in one context (e.g. a group chat) but 'unacceptable' in this one

- These might be described as 'too informal' or 'inappropriate' for emailing a professor

- The language is not seen as 'ill formed', just 'in the wrong situation'

---

## Let's see some informal register sentences

## Let's see some formal register sentences

### Discussion Questions

- Which of these example groups were hard to understand?

- Which of these example groups are your English teachers concerned with?

- Which of these example groups show the influence of *social norms*?

---

### More Discussion Questions

- What causes people to use *descriptively* ungrammatical language?

- What causes people to use *prescriptively* ungrammatical language?

- What causes people to change *register*?

## Descriptive Ungrammaticality applies to memes

### We'll explore descriptive grammaticality more soon!

- So be on the lookout for ill-formed memes and new language!

---

### Do the other two concepts exist in memes?

- That's our goal for the next activity!

---

## Important Terms

---

**Grammaticality**: Speaker intuitions about whether a chunk of language is 'correct', 'well-formed', 'valid', or 'understandable' in their language

---

**Prescriptively Ungrammatical**: A judgment that a chunk of language is 'wrong' or 'incorrect' on the basis of social, societal, contextual, or academic 'rules'.

**Descriptively Ungrammatical**: A judgment that a chunk of language is 'wrong' or 'incorrect' because it's violating speakers' *actual* grammar, and is thus unclear, ill-formed, or difficult to understand

---

**Register**: Different manners of speaking your language, which can be more or less appropriate in a given sociocultural context.  This often corresponds with 'formality'
