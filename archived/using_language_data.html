				# Making Data Work For You
				### Will Styler - Linguistics 2000

				---



				## There's a *lot* of language data out there.

				*<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 644 million active websites <small>(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-web-sites-are-are-there-2012-3">Source</a>)</small>

				*<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Mayo Clinic enters 298 million patient records per year <small>(<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/emr/">Source</a>)</small>
				
				*<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 58 million Tweets per day <small>(<a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/">Source</a>)</small>
				
				*<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 294 billion emails sent daily <small>(<a
 href="http://email.about.com/od/emailtrivia/f/emails_per_day.htm">Source</a>)</small>
 
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> ... and that's just the digital stuff


				---




				## What can we do with this data?
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Linguists want to use this data to learn about language
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Everybody else wants to use this data to learn about the world

				---




				## The Problem:
				Humans are inefficient and expensive.

				---




				<img src="img/hal9000.jpg">
				## The Solution


				---



				## I'm a linguist.  How can data help me?

				---



				> “... by using these existing standards, we hope to be able to leverage new technologies during processing.”

				---



				# The Question:
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				Was Will really talking like a corporate drone when he used “leverage” as a verb, or do lots of people do that outside the boardroom?


				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				For that matter, how is “leverage” usually used?
	

				---


				## So how do we ask that question?


				---



				<img width="40%" src="img/notebook.png">
				### Option #1

				---



				### Option #2: Corpora

				---



				### **Corpus (pl. Corpora)**: A collection of written or spoken texts assembled for the purpose of studying language

				---



				### There are many different corpora out there.

				---




				## The Brown Corpus

				~2,000,000 words of English fiction, books, humor, textbooks, reporting, and gov’t docs


				---



				## The Callhome Corpus

				Transcripts of 120 phone conversations (18.3 hours of speech)


				---



				## The Switchboard Corpus

				2430 conversations (~3,000,000 words of text) from phone calls


				---



				## The Broadcast News Corpus

				~1,243,526 words transcribed from various broadcast news sources


				---



				## The EnronSent Corpus
				96,106 email messages (~13,000,000 words) from the Enron Corporate Email Servers

				---



				## The Google Books Corpus
				All the text from every book in the “Google Books” service

				---



				## The Google Corpus
				The entire internet. At your fingertips

				---



				## The Lena Corpus
				Thousands of hours of recorded child and child- directed speech

				---



				## The Penn Treebank
				A large corpus of syntactically marked data (showing the tree structure of sentences)

				---



				## The Callhome Speech Corpus

				This corpus actually contains sound files, useful for speech geeks like myself

				---



				### (and many, many, *many* more)

				---



				### So, that’s a bunch of data. How do you actually ask your question?

				---



				## How to run a corpus search:
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1) Figure out where you want to look (which corpora)
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 2) Figure out exactly what you want to search for
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 3) Search for it
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 4) Sift through the results

				---



				<img src="img/highlighter.png">
				### Option #1

				---



				<img width="60%" src="img/hal9000.jpg">
				### Option #2

				---




				## So, to find out if leveraging is corporate-speak, I want to look...
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1) Someplace businessy
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 2) Someplace not businessy


				---



				## What would I need to look for?
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> leverage?
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> leveraged?
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> leverages					
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> leveraging

				---



				## How would I ask the computer to find that?
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Get your geek on by logging into our corpus server
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				“Find any lines in which EITHER “leverages” OR “leveraging” occurs
				<code class=fragment>egrep "leverages|leveraging" yourcorpus</code>


				---



				### Let's give it a try!

				---



				### This all looks complicated, but it gets easier quickly, and there’s usually someone around to help.

				---



				## Running stats helps too!

				By doing statistical analysis on your searches, you can measure whether the data really shows what you claim it does.

				---



				### Why make precise counts to test our hypotheses, then spend hours running statistical models?
				<br>
				<h4 class = fragment>So can we get to the most wonderful three letters in research...

				---






				<huge>QED</huge>
				<p class = fragment>“Quod Erat Demonstrandum”
				<h4 class = fragment>“I’m right, you’re wrong, here’s proof.  Booyeah!”

				---

				> "Only corporate drones use "leverage" as a verb"
				
				## is just your opinion.

				---



				<img width=80% src="img/justyouropinion.jpeg">	

				---

				> "Leverage was used as a verb 61 times in the Enron corpus, and none at all in the equally large callhome corpus"

				### ...is a victory dance of scientific wonder.

				---


				## ... but wait, there's more!

				### We’ve been looking at different corpora representing different types of speech, all from 1990-2011.
				## <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What if we could search through history with a corpus search to see how words are used over time?

				## Cool story, Bro.<br>
				### <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> ... but how can this data tell us about the real world?

				---




				## NLP - Natural Language Processing
				Teaching computers to “understand” human language

				---




				## Machine Learning in ∞ easy steps:
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1) Get a corpus and annotate it to tell the computer what’s going on
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 2) “Train” the computer by letting it analyze that corpus

				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 3) Give it a different corpus, have it try to guess what’s going on and answer questions

				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 4) Refine the programming, then get another corpus and annotate it to tell the computer what’s going on..

				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> (Repeat)

				---



				## “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up”

				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Sequence of events:
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1) Surgery
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 2) Mild rash
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 3) Hydrocortisone, Followup (overlapping)
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 4) No more rash

				---



				## If a computer can be taught to interpret time in medical records, we can ask...

				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "I have 30 seconds to learn this patient's history.  Go."
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “Are there any disorders or symptoms which often arise within six months of taking drug X?”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “How many patients treated with X later develop Y?”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				“How long do patients usually live following diagnosis Z?”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				“Is there any aspect of the patient’s history shared among all people with disease Q?”

				---



				## What else could you ask a well-trained computer to answer for you?

				---




				## “Watch Twitter and give me the locations of wildfires, floods, etc, and provide information about damage, shelters and resources in an easy-to-read format”
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> (EPIC)

				---



				## "Scan online white-supremacist forums for anything which looks like a threat against the President"
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> (The US Secret Service)

				## “Watch these websites being used by islamist groups and look for specific language usage patterns that predict violent and radical behavior.”
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> (All sorts of defense department grants)

				---



				## “Read every email, looking for threats or discussion of terrorist attacks on American soil.”

				### ... but not for a little while

				---



				## Why computers have an uphill battle:
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “The Queen of England’s hat was purple”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				“We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were ripe”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				“We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were hungry”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “The old man returned to his house was happy”

				---

				## Hooray!

				<img width="900" src="img/morpheus.png">

				---

				## You and language data can have a happy, loving relationship
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				All you need to do is ask lots of questions, pay attention to what your data tells you, and always think carefully about what you’re asking it.
				
				<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
				Maintain this relationship and your data will always be there for you to back you up, and you’ll live happily ever after.
