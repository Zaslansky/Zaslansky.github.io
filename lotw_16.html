---

### Fact of the Day

"Gangnam" is a wealthy area of Seoul, known for a very high standard of living

... and "Oppa" is the "Older Brother" honorific kinship term used by a younger woman to an older man

* So, he's saying to his young, female audience "Hey, this respected older man is Gangnam Style."

# Japanese, Korean, and "Altaic"
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Agenda

* Korean

* Japanese

* "Altaic"

---

### Today, we're going to be seeing a lot of Honorifics!

---

# Korean

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/koreanmap.png"> 

---

### Korean

* Some say it's an isolate, others say it's "Altaic"

	* We'll get there.
	
* Spoken by around 80 million people

---

### Features of Korean

* Agglutinative, SOV

* Vowel length and Vowel Harmony

* Hangul Writing System

* "Faucalized" or "Tense" consonants

* Honorifics

---

### We know all about Agglutination, SOV order, Vowel Length and Vowel harmony

* So, let's jump to the fun stuff

---

## Hangul Writing System

---

### Korean used to use *hanja*, an ideographic writing system

---

### Ideographic Writing System

Each concept or word has a symbol, with no correspondence to sound

---

<section data-background="lotwimg/chinesetattoos.jpg"></section>

---

### Ideographic Writing System

Each concept or word has a symbol, with no correspondence to sound

<danger>What are some problems with using an ideographic writing system?</danger>

---

## Hangul Writing System

* Created by Sejong the Great in 1443

* Replaced the Hanja ideographic writing system

	* Which was originally adapted from Chinese characters
	
* This is a *really* slick writing system

* It's a deeply *phonetic* alphabet

---

### Hangul is Phonetic!

* Velar consonants (아음, 牙音 a-eum "molar sounds")
	* ㄱ g [k], ㅋ k [kʰ]
	
* Coronal consonants (설음, 舌音 seoreum "lingual sounds"):
	* ㄴ n [n], ㄷ d [t], ㅌ t [tʰ], ㄹ r [ɾ, l]

* Bilabial consonants (순음, 唇音 suneum "labial sounds"):
	* ㅁ m [m], ㅂ b [p], ㅍ p [pʰ]

* Sibilant consonants (치음, 齒音 chieum "dental sounds"):
	* ㅅ s [s], ㅈ j [tɕ], ㅊ ch [tɕʰ]

* Dorsal consonants (후음, 喉音 hueum "throat sounds"):
	* ㅇ ng [ʔ, ŋ], ㅎ h [h]
---

### Syllable blocks are constructed by combining consonant symbols and vowel symbols

**English**

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

**Korean**

모든 인간은 태어날 때부터 자유로우며 그 존엄과 권리에 있어 동등하다. 인간은 천부적으로 이성과 양심을 부여받았으며 서로 형제애의 정신으로 행동하여야 한다.

---

### Which East Asian Language am I looking at?

* Japanese has small, curvy strokes with interspersed complex characters

* Chinese has mostly square-ish, complex characters.

* Korean has lots of circles and horizontal/vertical lines.

---

---

## Tense Consonants!

---

### Korean Tense Consonants

* When Korean speakers do... something... during consonants

* These are sometimes called "Double consonants"

* We linguists have little idea what's going on here

	* Maybe pitch?  Sub-glottal pressure?  

---

# ㅅ vs. ㅆ

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/faucalized.mp3"></audio>

---

## Honorifics!

---

### Korean Honorifics

* In Korean, verbs and adjectives take different morphemes marking relative social status

	* There are 7 different sets of verb conjugations based on formality

* Different affixes and pronouns create different "speech levels"

---

### Korean Speech Levels

* -ㅂ니다 - Honorific, Most Polite, Most Formal

* -(아/어/여)요 - Polite, natural, a bit formal

* -아/어/여 - Casual, Informal or Intimate

	* Usually used for younger people or close friends
	
	* You can ask permission to switch to this style
---

### Many Languages have formal vs. informal forms of address!

---

The most common is called the "T/V Distinction", where there's a simple "formal" and "informal" form

# Japonic Languages

---

### Japonic Languages

* Maybe be a top-level language, may be Altaic

* Main branch: Japanese (and its dialects) - Spoken by 125 Million People

* Other branch: Ryūkyūan languages

	* These are all endangered. :(

### Features of Japanese

* SOV word order, agglutinative

* CVCVCV Syllable Structure

* The Japanese "R"

* Extensive use of particles

* Extensive Honorific System

---

## Preference for CVCV

‘Merry Christmas' - merii kurisumasu

<small>([Image and Sound Credit](http://japanese.about.com/library/blqow33.htm))</small>

* *Japanese does not allow anything but consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel*

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/japanese_christmas.mp3"></audio>
 
---

## The Japanese "R"

---

Japanese and Korean speakers often struggle with the English "L" and "R"

* ### This is because Japanese and Korean have neither and both!

---

The English R (/ɹ/) is an Alveolar Approximant

* The English L (/l/) is an Alveolar Lateral Approximant

* The Japanese "R" is a postalveolar flap *which is not defined for laterality*.

	* This means that it can be lateral or not, and nobody cares
	
* The Korean "R" is very similar

	* Although it's slightly more predictable there.

---

When speaking Japanese and Korean, "lateral" is not a meaningful difference.

* **When Japanese and Korean speakers speak English, this makes life difficult!**

* Japanese and Korean speakers can master our very weird /ɹ/, but it takes time.

---

## Particles

---

### Japanese uses particles to give meaning to words in a sentence

* These particles act as a sort of "comment" on the topics raised

---

<lang>Japanese</lang><br><ldata>Japonic - Japan</ldata> 

**dokoro ka** - "Anything but" or "Far from"

*Kare wa keisatsukan **dokoro ka**, hanzaisha da.*

he be policeman dokoro ka, criminal be.

"Far from a policeman, he's a criminal!"

---


<lang>Japanese</lang><br><ldata>Japonic - Japan</ldata> 

**ka na** - "I wonder" (but I strongly suspect)

*Kare wa ayashii hito **ka na**.*

He be suspicious person ka na.

"I'm starting to wonder if he's a suspicious person.

---

<lang>Japanese</lang><br><ldata>Japonic - Japan</ldata> 

**nanka** - Shows disgust

*Jogen **nanka** iranai.*

Advice nanka I.need.not

"I don't need any (damn) advice!"

---

## Japanese Honorifics

---

### Honorifics in Japanese

* Word beautification (Adding prefixes to words to make them more "beautiful")

* Politeness registers

* Honorific Verb forms

* Honorific Titles

---

### Politeness Registers

* Many different ways to say "I ask you for a favor"

* **Between friends** - yoroshiku tanomu.

* **Polite** - yoroshiku tanomimasu

* **Business Formal** - yoroshiku onegai shimasu

* **Humble Formal** - yoroshiku onegai itashimasu.

* **Super-Polite formal** - yoroshiku onegai mōshiagemasu.

---

### Honorific Verb Forms

Different verbs are used depending on how polite you're being

---

### Politeness forms of "To Eat"

* Dictionary: Tabe-ru. 食べる

* Neutrally polite: Tabe-masu. 食べます

* Kinda polite: Tabe-rare-masu. 食べられます

* Super polite: Meshi'agari-masu. 召し上がります

* Humble: Itadaki-masu. 頂きます

---

### If you're being polite, you may need to use an entirely different verb to say the same thing!

---

### Honorific titles

* San (Title of respect between people of any age)

* Sama (People much higher in rank than yourself)

* Kun (People of lower rank, or close friends)

* Chan (Diminutive)

* Sensei (Teachers, doctors, politicians)

* Shi (People you've never met but respect)

---

### There's [a great deal more to Formality in Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific_speech_in_Japanese)

* ... but we never have time *nanka*.

	* That's the disgust particle.  Get it?!

"Wow, there sure are a lot of similarities between Japanese and Korean"

* **Maybe they're related!**

---

# Altaic

<img class="big" src="img/trenchwarfare.jpg"> 

---

### "Altaic"

* A proposed top-level family like Indo-European

* Attempts to unite Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, Japonic, and Ainu

* Still rather controversial

	* Yelling "Altaic is historically accurate" is a great way to start a fistfight at an LSA conference

* Two proposed groupings: "Macro-Altaic" and "Micro-Altaic"

---

**Macro-Altaic**: Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, Koreanic, Japonic, Ainu

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/altaicmap.png"> 

(Blue, Green, Red, Yellow, Purple and Maroon, respectively)

---

**Micro-Altaic**: Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/altaicmap.png"> 

(Blue, Green, and Red respectively)

---

### My Deepest Apologies to Mongolic, Tungusic, and Ainu

* These are all awesome language families, we just don't have the time.

---

### Macro- and Micro-Altaic

* There's more evidence for Micro-Altaic than for Macro-

	* Ethnologue includes Micro-Altaic, but not Macro
	
* Most Altaic supporters now believe in Macro-Altaic

* Many people still believe in neither!

---

### "Why can't we all just get along?"

<img class="big" src="humorimg/drumcircle.jpg"> 

---

### The Altaic Controversy

* **Pro-Altaic** - "These similarities come from genetics"

* **Anti-Altaic** - "These similarities come from contact and borrowings"

* <danger>Why is this debate difficult to prove or win?</danger>

---

### People are pretty much dug in

<img class="big" src="img/trenchwarfare2.jpg"> 

---

### So, is Altaic real, or not?

* ## Maybe.

* ... but even if it isn't, it's useful to know that the "Altaic" languages share some similarities

	* ... and you should probably know what families may be Altaic for the test...
	
---

### Wrapping Up

* Korean is awesome.

	* ... and has tons of Honorifics
	
* Japanese is awesome

	* ... and has tons of Honorifics
	
* Altaic may be a top-level language family 

	* * ... and it's nice to know about, in case you ever need to make a quiet escape from a typology conference
