The syllabus has been updated

## Grab an IPA/Features Handout by the door!

# Phonetics in Review

### Will Styler - LIGN 111

---
       
### Today's Plan

- Reviewing the IPA and other speech concepts

- General Phonetic Concepts for phonology

- Phonetics and Naturalness

---

## How do we describe how speech sounds are made?

---

### We break the world into two kinds of speech sounds

- **Consonants:** Constrict, obstruct, or divert air in the vocal tract when being produced

- **Vowels:** Shape the (unobstructed) vocal tract to change the sound emitted

---

## Describing Consonants

---
### Three steps to describing Consonants

* We need to know three things:

* **Place**: Where is the sound made?

* **Manner**: What are we doing there?

* **Voicing**: Are we making voicing?

---

---

### Can't figure out where in the mouth that is?

Ask [Sammy the Interactive Sagittal Section](http://smu-facweb.smu.ca/~s0949176/sammy/)!

---

### So, that's consonants.

---

## Vowels!

---

### Vowels are created by shaping your vocal tract

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---

---

### Vowels are different from consonants

- They're always* voiced

- They can (and do) occur on their own. I.

- We describe vowels using different characteristics

---

### Describing Vowels

- For vowels, we talk about three additional dimensions

- 1) Where is the tongue in terms of height?
  - (High, Low, or Mid)
  - Also "Closed, Open, or Mid"

- 2) Where is the tongue in terms of horizontal space?
  - (Front, Central, or Back)

- 3) Are your lips rounded or not?

---

### Diphthongs

- Vowels where the tongue moves through the mouth

- Start at one vowel, move to another vowel

- Things like ‚Äúboy‚Äù (/…îj/), ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (/aj/), ‚Äúbay‚Äù (/ej/), ‚Äúboat‚Äù (/ow/), ‚Äúcow‚Äù (/aw/)

- Others are monophthongs

---

### 'Other Symbols'

![](phonmedia/ipa_other.jpg)

---

### Non-Pulmonics

![](phonmedia/ipa_nonpulmonics.jpg)

---

### Suprasegmentals

---

### Tones

![](phonmedia/ipa_tone.jpg)


---

### Diacritics

<img class="wide" src="phonmedia/ipa_diacritics.jpg">

---

### This is how phoneticians describe sounds

---

## A few phenomena meriting additional discussion

---

### Aspiration and other Laryngeal Stuff

<img class="wide" src="phonmedia/aspiration_odden.jpg">

<small> Thanks to Odden's Introducing Phonology</small>

---

### Nasalization

![](phonmedia/sagittal_flesh.jpg)

---

### Impossible Consonants

<img class="wide" src="phonmedia/ipa_consonants.jpg"> 

---

### Impossible vowels?

---

### There are some common bits of non-standard IPA

- /r/ could mean /r/ or /…π/

- ≈° for / É/

- ≈æ for / í/

- ƒç for /t É/

- «∞ for /d í/

---

### Non-Standard IPA continued

- y for /j/

- √± for /…≤/

- Subscript dots for retroflexes

- : and Àê are both used for length

- Numerical tone markings (e.g. bi1 vs. bi5 vs. bi15 vs. bi31)

---

### Always be on the lookout for "This symbol refers to [sound description]"

---


# General Phonetic Concepts for Phonology

---

### Not all of phonology believes that it needs phonetics

- Government Phonology (c.f. Kaye, Lowenstamm, and Vergnaud 1985) builds a phonology almost devoid of phonetics

- Words are built from six primitives, (A), (I), (U), ( î), (L) and (H), which are cognitive, not acoustic or articulatory

- Individual sounds are generated via licensing, and interactions among primitives

---

![](humorimg/side_eye_chloe.jpg)

---

### (GP is fascinating, but this is the last time we'll talk about it)

---

## Phonological rules can be approached phonetically

---

### Phonology is not just 'algebra with symbols'

- ‚ôá turns into üúç before ‚òã

- /n/ turns into /≈ã/ before /g/

---

### Think about the articulatory space

![](phonmedia/sagittal_flesh.jpg)


---

### Think about concepts like coarticulation

- *Why* would /k/ be fronted before /i/?

---

### Think about overlap

- *Why* would /l/ become voiceless after /p ∞/

---

### Think about perception

- *Why* would adjacent spirants be undesirable? (e.g. why isn't the plural of 'kiss' /k…™ss/?)

---

### Think about jaw movement

- *Why* is /pl åmp/ legal while /lp åpm/ wouldn't be?

    - This is called 'sonority', and is very cool

---

### Think about laziness

- *Why* would an /n/ become an /m/ before /b/?

---

### Think about similarity

- Are /t/, /b/ and /h/ likely to be three alternate forms of the same sound?

- How do we know /≈ã/ and /h/ are different sounds in English?

---

### Much of the concept of "Naturalness" derives from articulation

- /m/ often becomes /b/, seldom /k/

- Natural Classes are a phonetic concept

---

### Phonetics can have very subtle effects

- Backing favors voicelessness

- Geminate consonants are more likely to be voiceless

    - ... and voiced ones are more likely to be fronted

- C.f. Ohala [Aerodynamics of Phonology](http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~ohala/papers/SEOUL2-aero.pdf)

    - Ohala, J. J. (1997, August). Aerodynamics of phonology. In Proceedings of the Seoul International Conference on Linguistics (Vol. 92, p. 97).

---

### ... but not all phonological phenomena are phonetically intuitive

- Post-nasal devoicing?

- Intervocalic devoicing?

- Final voicing?

- p -> b and k -> g but t -> l (e.g. Lakota)

- Often, this is sound change in process

---

### You can't expect all rules to make sense, phonetically

- Consider it a "hint", not a rule

---

### Homework 1 will be a quick reminder of phonetic concepts with an eye towards phonology

---

### Next time...

- We'll get naturally classy
