# Language and Culture
### LIGN 42 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- What is culture?

- How does culture shape language?

- How does language shape culture?

---

### We're doing this in an American context today

- But we could do this anywhere, with any language, just as well

---

### Languages are used in speech communities

- What are instances where a language might be mostly used in a particular...

	- Regional community

	- Racial community

	- Social community
	
	- Religious community

---

### Speech communities are communities

- All circles are circular, too

---

### Communities have specific culture

- Culture specifies that which changes when you change communities

---

### What has 'culture shocked' you, and where?

- Please describe kindly and neutrally!

---

### Culture is incredibly rich and all-encompassing

- Culture includes things like beliefs, arts, social practices, customs, laws, traditions, values, and knowledge

- Every community has a culture

	- Regional, Racial, Social, Religious, and more...
	
- Every culture has subcultures too

	- American nerds vs. bros
	
- So, every human is a part of at least one culture

---

### 'Same' or 'Different' cultures is a tough call

- It's like 'same or different language': Usually mostly a sociopolitical judgement

- Better to consider it to be gradient, and talk about groups

---

### Language is culturally transmitted

- We learn our language(s) from our linguistic and cultural surroundings

- Nobody learns their first language from Duolingo

---

### What did you *not get* learning a second language in a classroom?

- What did you have to learn once actually interacting with folks?

- Where was your knowledge *amusingly incomplete*?

---

### Understanding culture is important for understanding language

- What are some words which **require** American cultural knowledge to be understood?

- What are some words which **DO NOT require any** American cultural knowledge to be understood?

---

### Other kinds of language use have even more cultural links

- What's an *idiom or saying* which isn't (fully) understandable without cultural knowledge?

---

## How does cultural change affect language?

---

### Changes to the culture change the language

- What general changes to American English reflect changes in American culture?

- What new words have come about as a result of cultural shifts or additions?

- What new words or language have *infusions from other cultures* brought into mainstream US English?

---

### It's very hard to change the culture without changing the language!

- They're closely linked!

---

## How does language change affect the culture?

---

### Changes to language can cause cultural shifts

- There's a chicken-and-egg problem, but words and sayings can 'crystallize' issues and spread ideas

- [Some would argue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) that changes to language can change our cognition, and lead to changes in culture

---

### What are some words or sayings that...

- Weren't always present in the discourse

- Described something in or about our culture?

- 'Went viral' and caught on in the mainstream?

- Guided the debate, discourse, or progression of the culture?

- **What words or sayings have changed the culture?**

---

### This isn't always accidental

- People will use words creatively to 'frame' the debate

	- Tax Relief vs. Lowering tax revenue
	- Illegal Aliens vs. Undocumented People
	- Anti-Abortion vs. Pro-Life
	- 'Tender Age Shelters' vs. 'Child Detention Camps'
	- "Peacekeeping Operation"
	
- **Can you think of other ways where language was used to manipulate the culture?**

---

## Language and Culture are constantly shifting together

---

### It's hard to establish directionality

- Does the word 'Karen' reflect a recognized cultural phenomenon, or is the word 'Karen' creating a recognized cultural phenomenon?

- Does 'OK Boomer' cause disrespect, or reflect extant disrespect?

---

### It's hard to establish boundaries between language and cultural practice

- ... so often, it's easier to just look at the intersection and describe what's going on there

---

## We live in a society

---

### Culture is everywhere, and language interlaces with it

- We are all part of many cultures

- Our language affects our culture perhaps as much as our culture affects our language

- It's very hard to draw lines between the two phenomena

---

### Therefore, we meme in a society, too

- ... and this week, we're going to think more about what that means and looks like

- ... and how memes and the internet can change the culture!

---

### "Memes changing the course of the culture" sounds wild, but it isn't

- In fact, here's a great example...

---

### The Dean Scream

- Howard Dean, Governor of Vermont

	- US Presidential Primary Candidate in 2004, would lose to John Kerry
	
- Had just placed Second in the Iowa Caucus

- Gave a speech in Des Moines, Iowa

> Albright-Hanna, a _CNN_ reporter at the event, explained, "there was a sense that it was really loud, but it just felt like a typical rally. Nothing out of the usual happened. Nobody remembered a moment happening at all."

---

### Then it became a meme

- TV news, late night shows, and countless remixes

- Dean slipped into the back of the pack, and now people mostly remember the scream

- It's widely considered to be have marked (and caused) the end of his serious campaign

---

### This dumb meme brought down a politician

- Never feel like memes are powerless!

---

### This week, we'll work at the intersection of language and culture

- ... and think more about what culture even looks like online!
