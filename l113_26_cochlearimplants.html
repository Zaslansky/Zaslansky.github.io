# Cochlear Implants and Hearing

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- CI Review

- CI Processing Strategies

- What about auditory brainstem implants?

- What is CI hearing like?

---

## Review: What is a cochlear implant?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_diagram.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

## What is CI hearing like?

---

## Different!

---

### Why is CI hearing so different?

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

### CIs depend on the use of 'processor' algorithms

- "How do we turn the continous spectrum of sound into pulses on a fixed number of electrode channels?"

- There are many different processing algorithms

	- Things like CIS, ACE, HiRes120

	- These are chosen by the patient and their audiologist

	- Many devices can be adjusted to use a new or different one

- Each one uses different methods to transform sounds into a pulse train on the electrodes

- They are severely constrained by real-time running, battery life and processing power

---

### Cochlear Implant Coding, Generically

- Take the input signal

- Do an FFT (or use a bank of band-pass filters)

	- Get 16-22 individual 'bands'

- Take the 'spectral envelope' for each band

	- The amplitude in each frequency band

- Now use those envelopes to decide the pulses sent to electrodes

	- Pulses are sent at anywhere from 900-1800 Hz

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisefft.jpg">

---

### One major problem

- Neighboring electrodes interfere with each other!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

### We want to use all the channels

- ... but we don't want to use all of them at once

---

### Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) Coding

- Do the thing above, choosing the same number of bands as you have electrodes

- Every electrode gets activated, one after the other, in a fixed sequence

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

### Advanced Combinatorial Encoder (ACE) Coding

- Do the thing above, choosing the same number of bands as you have electrodes

- Choose the N highest amplitude bands (often 8-10) and stimulate **only** those electrodes

- The person is given only the *loudest* bands, more often

- This keeps neighboring electrodes from interfering with each other

---

### Other approaches take other strategies

- Dedicating some channels to 'temporal fine structure' (e.g. voice pulses)

	- 'We'll have two channels that accurately track any pitch below the pulse rate'

- 'Virtual channels'

	- e.g. turning up channels 2 and 3 at the same time when there's something at 2.5

---

(The following figures are from [Wouters et al. 2015, Sound coding in cochlear implants: from electric pulses to hearing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7038260)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_codingboyfell.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_codingboy.jpg">

---

### There are many algorithms

- This is an active area of research!

- New encoders can mean major improvements for hearing

	- CIS to ACE offered 6-9% gains in speech recognition (c.f. Wouter et al. citing Skinner et al.)

- This is the 'software' that allows the machine to optimally mesh with the mind

---

### All of these methods are *lossy*!

---

### Lots of information goes away

- Continuous spectrum -> 22 channels

- The dynamic range is very small (~10 dB)

- The frequency range can be much smaller

- Masking effects can be complete within bands

	- You cannot tell A+B from A or B within a single channel

---

### We lose some other detailed information

- Fine temporal information goes away

	- "What is the fundamental frequency?" can be hard to ask

- Pinna cues aren't preserved

	- Lack of frequency resolution

	- Positioning of microphone

- Interaural time and amplitude differences can disappear too!

	- The two ears aren't always on the same clock cycles

	- Amplitude differences are subtle and can be squashed

	- Many people have just one CI

---

### This means that CI sound perception is DIFFERENT

- Really, REALLY different

- 'Simulating' CI hearing is not possible

	- You can distort sound into 22 bands, but that's *not* really the same thing
    
	- ... but it can be a useful abstraction for raising awareness

	- 'The Sound of Metal' does this well

---

### Here's a simulation of CI-mediated hearing

It's a bit generous, and includes different numbers of channels, but gives a sense of what to expect.

<audio controls src="hearing/ci_simulation.mp3"></audio>

---

### This is a fundamentally different mode of perception

- Computationally-mediated nerve stimulation  

- The fact that it's happening in the cochlea is a matter of convenience

---

### Wait a second

- Could we do this same sort of stimulation, on other nerves?

- **Yes!**

---

## Auditory Brainstem Implants

---

### Auditory Brainstem Implants

- "Instead of stimulating the Spiral Ganglion based on sound, let's do the same thing near the base of the 8th nerve"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/auditory_brainstem_implant.jpg">

---

### Same idea, different stimulation point

- Turn audio into bands

- Turn bands into pulses

- Put pulses on nerves

- Let the brain sort it out

---

### ABIs have many of the same strengths and drawbacks as CIs

- They just differ in deployment

- ABIs work even when the 8th nerve is damaged beyond the cochlea

- The surgery is far more invasive

- So, *if you can go the CI route, they're usually a better choice than ABIs*

---

### ... but how good of a choice are either of them?

---

## Cochlear Implant Hearing

---

### You don't just 'turn it on' and people are non-Deaf

- 'Turning it on' immediately gives sensation of sound

	- "There is more noise now than before"

	- "Huh, beep"

- ... but then the work starts!

---

### There are many things configured during 'fitting'

- Different processing strategies

- Different settings

	- Number of simultaneous bands

	- Pulse rate

- Different 'loudness' by frequency

	- 'MCL', or 'Most Comfortable Loudness'

---

### Cochlear Implant hearing requires (re)habilitation

- Your brain needs to (re-)learn how to model the world from these pulses

- Tonotopic organization helps, but the signal is still *fundamentally* different

- Neuroplasticity plays a big role here

	- Young children often have better outcomes than adults

---

### Measuring Outcomes

- How do we want to evaluate outcomes for people?

- What matters most when evaluating CI 'effectiveness'?

- *All of this varies **greatly** from person to person!*

---

### Can CI users detect sound?

- Massive success!

- "Huh, beep" perception is more or less universal

---

### Can CI users detect separate sounds playing at once?

- Yes!

- "How well can the different channels be discriminated?"

	- Channel 2 may not 'sound' reliably different from channel 3

	- Channel 2+3 may not sound different from 2 or 3

	- Channels 2 and 5 may even be hard to tell apart

- Not all channels may be available to all people

	- Remember issues with insertion depth?

---

### What do puretone thresholds look like for CI users?

> Children with profound hearing impairment who received cochlear implants performed equally to children with severe hearing impairment treated with hearing aids on half of the performance tests. - de Kleijn et al. 2018

> All patients showed hearing improvement over time. Aided thresholds improved significantly (p < 0.01) from a mean of 62.3 dB HL with the preimplant hearing aid to a mean of 39.2 dB HL at 3 months after implantation and 36.3 dB HL at 12 months after implantation (fig. 1). - Lachowska et al. 2015

---

Fig 3: Lachowska et al. 2015

---

### What does music and sound perception look like?

- Music appreciation is generally very hard for CI users

- Identifying specific auditory patterns (e.g. birdsongs, or differing tone patterns) may be very difficult

- Much of 'natural noise' is missing or distorted

---

### How reliably can adult CI users hear speech?

- The story varies!

- **Pre-lingually** deafened adults don't generally learn to recognize words

- For post-lingually deafened adults, ~35-45% correct words and 65-80% sentence scores

	- ... but there's a lot of variability!

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_elderly_speech_2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_elderly_speech_3.jpg">

---

### How about kids?

- Children range from ~4-75% accuracy on words, and around 61% accuracy for sentences

- Word-in-isolation and sentence scores don't account for context

- **This is not natural hearing, but it's not nothing!**

---

### Remember that this is in isolated testing!

- Background noise complicates perception substantially

- CIs can be amazing in quiet rooms, but useless at parties

- 'The Sound of Steel' did an amazing job capturing this

---

### How do people *feel* about their cochlear implants?

> The first subgroup of implanted elderly (6 patients, 20%) - showing very good benefits - also displayed very good perception of spoken language through the auditory-sensory modality with familiar and unfamiliar speakers without assistance from lipreading, and with a little help from lipreading in noisy environments. Most of them were able to have a conversation over the phone. After implantation, these elderly became more active in everyday life, often met with neighbors and friends, and were open to meet new people. The mean implant-aided free-field audiometric threshold was <30 dB HL. The oldest patient was 87 years old. - Lachowska et al. 2015

---

### How do people *feel* about their cochlear implants?

> The second subgroup of implanted elderly (20 patients, 67%) showing good benefits - also demonstrated good perception of spoken language through the auditory-sensory modality with a little help from lipreading. The cochlear implant provided better communication and enabled improved contact with other people leading to increased independence in everyday life. Their mean implant-aided free-field audiometric threshold was between 30 and 50 dB HL. The oldest patient was 87 years old. - Lachowska et al. 2015

---

### How do people *feel* about their cochlear implants?

> In a survey of over 20,000 deaf children implanted since 2000, 47 percent had stopped using their CI 

- (Humphries et al 2016)

---

### Variability is the key takeaway

- CIs are *never* like natural hearing

- CIs are an amazing choice for some

- They're a minor improvement for others

- They're useless or harmful for others still

- **This is a medical intervention with potential risks and rewards, not a 'sure thing'**

---

### To summarize

---

### Cochlear Implants often provide benefit, albeit at a cost!

- Most people will have some sensation of sound from them

- Some people gain the ability to speak and understand spoken language

- Improvements to lip-reading ability may also improve quality of spoken perception

- The 'option' to hear can be situationally useful

---

### Cochlear Implants do not 'restore hearing'

- ... any more than a hook restores having a hand

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hook_hand.jpg">

---

### This idea leads to offensive and incautious messaging

- "CIs will fix your deaf child and let them lead a normal life!"

- "With CIs, your child won't need to resort to signed language!"

- "If you can afford CIs for your children, not doing so is neglectful!"

- "In the worst case, they can just learn sign and join the deaf community!"

- **Each one of these statements is problematic!**

---

### ... but there exists a middle ground

- Bicultural/Bilingual approaches

- CIs targeted for environmental awareness only

- Use of these implants as tools

- **The best approach is what's best for the individual!**

---

### More info on CIs

- [Here's a detailed document from ASHA](https://www.asha.org/policy/TR2004-00041)

---


### We need to understand the variance to understand the attitudes

- CIs can be a life-changing enhancement, providing the ability to hear and understand speech

- CIs can also be a spectacular waste of $30,000-60,000 dollars, which don't merit continued use

- There's relatively little indication as to which people will have which experience

---

### Will's Personal takeaway

- There's no harm in teaching and learning sign

	- Bilingualism is never harmful, and signed language is guaranteed to work well for Deaf folks

- 'Going all in' on CIs and Spoken language is unwise

	- There's some indication that early sign exposure improves outcomes for spoken language with CIs

	- You can't guarantee a good outcome from the CIs, and language deprivation is a *major* risk

- Attitudes like "CIs are always bad and getting them makes you bad" are equally unwise

	- They can be great for some, and people's choices and body autonomy should be respected

- **Your role is to give choices and information, grounded in science and data**

---

### Wrapping Up

- Cochlear Implants stimulate the nerves directly based on incoming audio

- Processing algorithms turn sound into stimulation

- ABIs work the same way, but deeper down the nerve!

- CI-mediated hearing is not the same as natural hearing

- There's massive variability in outcomes from person to person

---

### Next time

- What questions remain?

- 'What was the most interesting thing you learned this quarter?'

- Wrapping up the course
