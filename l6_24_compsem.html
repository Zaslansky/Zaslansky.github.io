# Computational Semantics
### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---

### Today's Plan

- Why do we need meaning?

- Semantics and Pragmatics

- Lexical Semantics

- Wordnet and Word Relationships

---

### Dependency parsing gives us some elements of meaning

- Subject of the verb

- Object of the verb

- What modified the action of the verb

- *We know things about the relationships among participants in the sentence*

---

### Gerflem flumduzzled the garibdo gerbeebily in Barblabble.

- "Was the garibdo flumduzzled?"

- "Where did the flumduzzling happen?"

- "How was the garibdo flumduzzled?"

- "What did Gerflem do?"

- What *can't* we ask?

---

### It's all still gibberish until we know what the words mean

---

### Today, we're getting into 'meaning' and 'understanding'

- Moving past grammatical knowledge into world knowledge

---

# Why do we need meaning?

---

### Many NLP tasks require little actual knowledge about the world or words

- Alexa, create an event at 3pm called "Visit my watchmaker"

- Alexa, add oranges and apples and candy bars to my shopping list

	- Alexa, are apples on my shopping list?

- Hey Siri, find all emails about "Moving expenses"

---

### ... but these commands become fragile quickly

- Alexa, do I have any appointments with people who fix clocks?

- Alexa, are there fruit on my shopping list?

- Hey Siri, find all emails related to my San Diego move


---

### We expect these systems to do 'inference'

---

## Inference

The use of evidence, world knowledge, and reasoning to reach a conclusion

- "Using what you already know to go deeper"

---

### We expect some level of inference

> "Sarah has three dogs, eight cats, two hamsters, four ferrets, and a son."

- "Does Sarah have three dogs?"

- "Does Sarah have a dog?"

- "Does Sarah have any animals?"

- "Is Sarah an animal hoarder?"

---

### Other kinds of inference

- Alexa, what's my first appointment of the day?

	- She lists first four appointments

- Alexa, where will I be on September 8th?

	- She lists all events

- Alexa, do I have free time for lunch today?

	- "Hmm, I don't know how to do that"

---

### We need to understand more than just the given text for these questions!

- We need meaning!

---
			 
# What is 'meaning'?

---

### We mean two things when we discuss what X 'means'

- "What does this *always* mean, regardless of context or circumstance?"

	- This is **Semantics**

- "What does this mean *in this particularly context or circumstance*?"

	- This is **Pragmatics**

---

### "John is in the living room"

- What does this *always* mean?

- What meanings could this have *in specific situations*?

---

## Semantics

The study of meaning in Language

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in language *in context*

---

### We're going to start with semantics, then head into Pragmatics next week

---

### Semantics is a large field of linguistics

- What is the relationship between linguistic signs, and the things they signify

- "How can we determine the 'truth' or logical meaning of a sentence?"

- "What do words, phrases, sentences, and narratives actually mean?"

- "What differentiates word meanings?"

---

### There are many approaches to Semantics

- **Formal Semantics**: Semantics distilled down to logic from sentences

- **Cognitive Semantics**: What does meaning look like in the mind?

- **Lexical Semantics**: What do individual words mean?

---

### Each of these can be interesting in Computational Semantics

- ... but we're going to focus on Lexical semantics here, for lack of time

---

# Lexical Semantics

---

### Lexical Semantics is the study of word meaning

- The senses of a given word

- The relationships that words have to one another

- The arguments that words generally take

	- This is next week

---

### First, an important resource

---

### WordNet

- [WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn) is a Lexical Database

- It contains English words, their senses, as well as their relationships to other words

- WordNet (and resources like it) are *hugely* important to computational Linguistics

- We're going to refer to it a lot!

---

## Word Senses

---

### We've already talked some about polysemy

- Words can have many 'senses'

- Bank of a river, Bank of America, Bank of a Poker game

- Lit (party) vs. Lit (fire) vs. English Lit

- A word's sense is *crucial*

	 - Every element of a word's meaning can change with a change in sense
	
---

### Bass (from WordNet)

<small>

- S: (n) bass (the lowest part of the musical range)
- S: (n) bass, bass part (the lowest part in polyphonic music)
- S: (n) bass, basso (an adult male singer with the lowest voice)
- S: (n) sea bass, bass (the lean flesh of a saltwater fish of the family Serranidae)
- S: (n) freshwater bass, bass (any of various North American freshwater fish with lean flesh)
- S: (n) bass, bass voice, basso (the lowest adult male singing voice)
- S: (n) bass (the member with the lowest range of a family of musical instruments)
- S: (n) bass (nontechnical name for any of numerous edible marine and freshwater spiny-finned fishes)
- S: (adj) bass, deep (having or denoting a low vocal or instrumental range) "a deep voice"; "a bass voice is lower than a baritone voice"; "a bass clarinet"

</small>

---

### Slug (from WordNet)

<small>

- S: (n) bullet, slug (a projectile that is fired from a gun)
- S: (n) slug (a unit of mass equal to the mass that accelerates at 1 foot/sec/sec when acted upon by a force of 1 pound; approximately 14.5939 kilograms)
- S: (n) slug (a counterfeit coin)
- S: (n) sluggard, slug (an idle slothful person)
- S: (n) slug (an amount of an alcoholic drink (usually liquor) that is poured or gulped) "he took a slug of hard liquor"
- S: (n) type slug, slug (a strip of type metal used for spacing)
- S: (n) slug (any of various terrestrial gastropods having an elongated slimy body and no external shell)
- S: (n) punch, clout, poke, lick, biff, slug ((boxing) a blow with the fist) "I gave him a clout on his nose"

</small>

---

### How can we tell which word sense is being used right now?

---

## Word Sense Disambiguation

Using machine learning to detect *which sense* a usage of a written word represents

---

### Word Sense Disambiguation is done using two features

- The word's POS tag

	- This gives us 'lit' (v.) a fire vs. a 'lit' (adj.) party vs. English 'lit' (n.)

- The word's 'embedding'

	- 'What occurs within N words to both sides of the target word'

	- "bass" fish vs. instrument vs. sound frequency vs. singer

	- "slug" creature vs. bullet vs. punch vs. drink vs. lazy person

- Assumption: "One sense per discourse"

---

### Word Sense Disambiguation is hard

- Accuracy depends on how *coarse* your senses are

	- Are you trying to disambiguate Freshwater, Saltwater, and 'common use' bass?
	
- It relies on good descriptions of the senses available

- It relies on *up-to-date* descriptions of the senses available

	- [WordNet doesn't currently have the new sense of 'lit'](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=lit) 

---

### ... we're just going to assume that went OK!

- Big assumption

---

### Now that we know the word's sense, what else do we want to know?

---

# Word Meaning Relationships

---

### Words have meanings

- Different words have related meanings

- ... and we find it helpful to talk about those relationships by classifying them

---

### Word Relationships

- Synonym/Antonym

- Metonymy

- Hyponym/Hypernym (Subtype/Supertype)

- Meronym/Holonym (Part/Whole)

---

## Synonym

A words which shares the same denotational meaning, but with different spoken form

- e.g. Cop/Police Officer, Sick/Ill, Sofa/Couch

- The usage may be slightly different, but they 'mean' the same thing

- WordNet divides words into 'Synsets'

---

### Hot Dog (frank.n.02) WordNet Synonyms

> {'frankfurter', 'frank', 'dog', 'wiener', 'hot_dog', 'wienerwurst', 'hotdog', 'weenie'}

---

## Antonym

A word which has a (nearly) opposite denotational meaning

- e.g. up/down, sick/healthy, happy/sad, dead/alive, do/undo

- "exactly" opposite is hard, but nearly opposite is fine

---

### Good (good.a.01) WordNet Antonym

> {'bad'}

---

## Hyponym/Hypernym

A word which is a specific instance of a broader class

- e.g. Poodle/Dog, Laptop/Computer, iPad/Tablet, Skyscraper/Building

- The greater class is a "hypernym"

- "X is a type of Y": X are hyponyms, Y is the hypernym

---

### Hot Dog (frank.n.02) WordNet Hypernym path

> [[Synset('entity.n.01'), Synset('physical_entity.n.01'), Synset('matter.n.03'), Synset('solid.n.01'), Synset('food.n.02'), Synset('meat.n.01'), Synset('sausage.n.01'), Synset('frank.n.02')]]

---

### Poodle (poodle.n.01) WordNet Hypernym Paths

> [Synset('entity.n.01'), Synset('physical_entity.n.01'), Synset('object.n.01'), Synset('whole.n.02'), Synset('living_thing.n.01'), Synset('organism.n.01'), Synset('animal.n.01'), Synset('domestic_animal.n.01'), Synset('dog.n.01'), Synset('poodle.n.01')]]

> [Synset('entity.n.01'), Synset('physical_entity.n.01'), Synset('object.n.01'), Synset('whole.n.02'), Synset('living_thing.n.01'), Synset('organism.n.01'), Synset('animal.n.01'), Synset('chordate.n.01'), Synset('vertebrate.n.01'), Synset('mammal.n.01'), Synset('placental.n.01'), Synset('carnivore.n.01'), Synset('canine.n.02'), Synset('dog.n.01'), Synset('poodle.n.01')]

---

### Hot Dog (frank.n.02) WordNet Hyponyms

> [Synset('vienna_sausage.n.01')]

---

### Poodle (poodle.n.01) WordNet Hyponyms

> [Synset('large_poodle.n.01'), Synset('miniature_poodle.n.01'), Synset('standard_poodle.n.01'), Synset('toy_poodle.n.01')]

---

## Meronymy/Holonomy

The relationship between a part and its whole

- Parts are meronyms of the whole

- Wholes are holonyms of the parts

- Can be thought of as parts (car/door) vs. substances (human/water)

---

### Car (car.n.01) WordNet Meronyms

> [Synset('accelerator.n.01'), Synset('air_bag.n.01'), Synset('auto_accessory.n.01'), Synset('automobile_engine.n.01'), Synset('automobile_horn.n.01'), Synset('buffer.n.06'), Synset('bumper.n.02'), Synset('car_door.n.01'), Synset('car_mirror.n.01'), Synset('car_seat.n.01'), Synset('car_window.n.01'), Synset('fender.n.01'), Synset('first_gear.n.01'), Synset('floorboard.n.02'), Synset('gasoline_engine.n.01'), Synset('glove_compartment.n.01'), Synset('grille.n.02'), Synset('high_gear.n.01'), Synset('hood.n.09'), Synset('luggage_compartment.n.01'), Synset('rear_window.n.01'), Synset('reverse.n.02'), Synset('roof.n.02'), Synset('running_board.n.01'), Synset('stabilizer_bar.n.01'), Synset('sunroof.n.01'), Synset('tail_fin.n.02'), Synset('third_gear.n.01'), Synset('window.n.02')]

---

### Mouth (mouth.n.02) WordNet Holonyms

> [Synset('face.n.01')]

---

### What kinds of questions can we answer knowing just word relations?

Synonym/Antonym

Hyponym/Hypernym (Subtype/Supertype)

Meronym/Holonym (Part/Whole)

---

### Sample inferences which can come from WordNet

- "Karen has three dogs", "Does she have any animals?"

- "Roger has a car", "Does he have an automobile?"

- Alexa, are all terriers dogs?

	- "Yes, terriers are dogs"

- Alexa, are all dogs terriers?

	- "No, dogs are not terriers"
	
- Alexa, are humans animals?

	- "Yes.  A person or human being belongs to the Homo Sapiens species, which make a person an animal biologically speaking."

---

### WordNet (and related resources) are *really* useful

- This is why they've been created for many different languages

- ... and expanded (c.f. [BabelNet](https://babelnet.org))

- ... and even used for translation (c.f. [Open Multilingual Wordnet](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/))

- WordNet is built into NLTK

	- [Here's a script I wrote to query it for this class](savethevowels.org/6/wordnetquery.py)
	
---

### ... but WordNet is missing some things

---

### Hit

- I hit the dragon with an arrow

- SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share

- Rob loves to hit the golf course on Fridays

- The mafia hit stunned the local government

- The fingerprints had three hits on old records

- I hit on the dragon at the sleazy bar

- I hit up the dragon for some gold until payday

---

### WordNet tells us nothing about how words interact with other elements of the sentence

- Nothing about the *arguments* they need

- Nothing about what's happening to the associated arguments

- Nothing about the *roles* that other items in the sentence play

- *Next time, we'll get there!*

---

### Wrapping up

- We need our NLP systems to interact with *meaning*

- We're going to focus on Lexical Semantics, word meaning, for this class

- WordNet is a great resource for understanding more about words

- Knowing the relationships between words can get us surprisingly far

---

### For Next Time

- We all have a role to play in the grand verb of life
