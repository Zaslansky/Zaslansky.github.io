### The Midterm

* You'll walk in, sit down, and begin the test

* 40 Scantron-based Multiple Choice questions, 1 short answer, one long answer

* Plan to write 1/2 page (or less) for the long answer

* You'll have until 11:54 to complete the exam

* ***Bring a Number 2 pencil!***

* If you miss the exam, you've either got a doctor's note or a zero

---

# Your Friend!

<img class="big" src="img/pencil.jpg"> 

---

### Things you will need to do

* Match languages to families

* Match features to language families

* Understand linguistic concepts

* Analyze a very basic dataset

* ***Bring a Number 2 pencil!***

---

### Things you will *not* need to do

* Repeat language-specific details

	* No "What is the Ergative case marker in Nepali?"

* Remember how many people speak a given language

* Remember sub-families outside of Indo-European

---

### The Long Answer


* Plan on half a page maximum.  

* Concise and complete answers are very possible to some of the questions.  

* Remember, you're showing your knowledge of the material, not trying to sell me anything.

* Please skip the "Fusional Morphology is a really important part of language, and is perhaps the greatest phenomenon ever..." niceties :)

* You've had the questions for almost two weeks.  Make sure your thoughts are in order *before* you come in.

---

### Multiple Choice Tips 

* Eliminate the obviously wrong answers first

	* I can't resist the occasional joke answer.  It'll usually be "E".

* If you don't have the answer, circle the contenders on your test sheet and come back.

* *Choose the **best** answer*

---

### Let's talk about that

---

### Which of the below features is *not* commonly associated with Caucasian languages?

a. Agglutinative Morphology

b. Ejective consonants

c. Scarcity of vowels

d. Ergative/Absolutive Case Systems

e. Templatic Morphology

---

### All rules have exceptions

* Ewe has no Noun Classes, but Niger-Congo usually does 

* English has no grammatical gender, but Germanic usually does.

* Chechen and Ingush have a bunch of vowels, but Caucasian languages usually don't.

	* (There's vowel-sparseness in many widely-spoken NE Caucasian languages (e.g. Lezgin, Avar, Lak))

* **Few of these generalizations about families are *always* true.**

---

### "Only the Sith deal in Absolutes!"

<img class="big" src="humorimg/obiwan.jpg"> 

---

### ... but we don't even *need* to worry about these exceptions

---

### Which of the below features is *not* commonly associated with Caucasian languages?

a. Agglutinative Morphology

b. Ejective consonants

c. Scarcity of vowels

d. Ergative/Absolutive Case Systems

e. Templatic Morphology

---

### Which of the below features is *not* commonly associated with Caucasian languages?

a. Agglutinative Morphology

b. Ejective consonants

c. Scarcity of vowels

d. Ergative/Absolutive Case Systems

<correct>e. Templatic Morphology</correct>

---

Even if "Scarcity of vowels" has some exceptions, "Templatic morphology" is not remotely associated with Caucasian.

---

"Scarcity of vowels" is not the answer you're looking for.

<img class="big" src="humorimg/mindtrick.jpg">
---

### On exams, as in life, choose the best answer.

* We try to always give one *great* answer, even if some of the others seem iffy.

	* ... and if you think there really are two very right answers, please do ask (tactfully)!

---

## Any Midterm questions?

---

# Oh English, you so crazy
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### *"Why can't these immigrants just learn English?!?"*

* <img class="big" src="humorimg/murica.png"> 

---

## "Uh, have you looked at English lately??"

---

### Nearly every part of this language is completely bizarre.

* Non-Native Speakers: You know the deal.

---

Let's look at this from an outsider's perspective

## The Sound System

---

### /ɹ/eally?

* Very few languages use /ɹ/

	* Mandarin Chinese shares this crazy

* We've got a bunch of ways to make it

---

### /ð/ and /θ/

* Interdental sounds are fairly rare, too

* They're considered rude in many cultures

---

### Our vowel system

---

* / i, ɪ, e, ɛ, æ, ə, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

* /aj, oj, ej, ow, aw/

* Few languages have us beat

	* (Rub it in, Danish)

### Date vs. Debt

---

# Date

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date1.mp3"></audio>

---

# Debt

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date12.mp3"></audio>

---

## ?

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date4.mp3"></audio>

---

## ??

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date8.mp3"></audio>

---

## ???

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date6.mp3"></audio>

---

### Let's do an experiment!

---

## ????

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date_debt_11_steps.mp3"></audio>

---

### So yeah, our vowel system is crazy

---

All of this crazy is concealed by...

---

## The Writing System

---

<img src="phonmedia/aeiou.png">

---

# Ghoti

<img class="big" src="img/fish_dieter.jpg">


---

### Ghoti

* "gh" from "rough"

* "o" from "women"

* "ti" from "action"

* Pronounced like "Fish"

---

## Knight

<img class="big" src="humorimg/blackknight.jpg">

---

Then, we use these sounds to do silly things in the rest of the language

---

## Prepositions

---

I've got a conference [at/in] Hellems

* \*I've got a conference at Indiana

* ?I've got a conference at Indianapolis

* I've got a meeting ø next week

---

---

Fish.

<img class="big" src="img/fish_jonydieter.jpg">

---

Fishes.

<img class="big" src="img/fish_fishes.jpg">

---

Leaf -> Leaves

* Wife -> Wives

* Staff -> ??

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 

### The plural of "staff" is...

a) Staffs (rhymes with "graphs")

b) Staffs (rhymes with "calves")

c) Staves (rhyme with "caves")

d) Stife (because English.)

---

### Staffs

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img height="1000" src="lotwimg/staff.jpg"></th>
    <th><img height="1000" src="lotwimg/staff.jpg"></th>

  </tr>
</table>
</center> 

---

### Staves

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/tenofwands.jpg">

---

Mouse -> Mice

* Louse -> Lice

* House -> Hice, right?

* Spouse -> ...

---

### Polygamy adds spice to life!

* <img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg"> 

---

* (This is a language joke, not a political statement)

---

### Count vs. Mass nouns

* I have a car

	* This is a "count noun"

* \*I have a sand.

	* This is a "mass noun"

* \* I ate an asparagus

* I ate a french fry
* 
---

### Count nouns can be treated like mass nouns

* I saw a raccoon on the road

* I saw some raccoons on the road

* I saw some raccoon on the road

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/escalatedquickly.jpg">

---

Speaking of dead animals...

---

## I have cow with English

---

### What'd you have for dinner?

* ?I had cow. 
	* Needs to be "beef"

* ?I had pig.
	* "Pork"

* ?I had deer
	* "Venison"

* I had chicken.

* I had lamb

---

### Animals are count nouns, foods are mass nouns

* I hugged three pigs, \*I ate three porks

* I bought some cows, I bought some beef

---

(Yet, Will has several beefs with Michael Bay)

* Beeves?

---

## Affixes

---

### English has lots of prefixes and suffixes

* i- 
	* As in "iPhone", "iPad", "iMac", "iDock", "iBrator"

* -sauce 
	* As in "sadsauce", "awesomesauce", ?"concisesauce", ?"pedanticsauce"

* -holic/-holism
	* As in "alcoholic", "chocoholic", "workaholic", "enchiladaholism", ?"phonologoholic"

---

### ... but it has exactly one infix

---

### Infix

A affix which is inserted into the middle of the word 
 
---

Will I tell you what it is?

* ### Abso-fucking-lutely

---

### "Fucking" is the only infix in the English language

* ... and it has very strict rules where it can go

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 

### Add a -fucking- infix to the word "constitutional"

a) Cons-fucking-titutional

b) Consti-fucking-tutional

c) Constitu-fucking-tional

d) Constitution-fucking-al

---

### *Expletives must occur immediately prior to the stressed syllable*

* "Missi-fucking-sippi"
	
	* *Miss-fucking-isippi

* "He's a deon-fucking-tologist"

* "Antidisestablishmen-fucking-tarianism"

---

It's about time we learned the rule for that!

---

## It

---

It ate my homework

* It's getting hot in here

* It burns when I eat Habañeros

* It sucks when Michael Bay remakes your childhood favorites

* It's about time we fix our writing system

---

### Shouldn't we do something about that?

* Which means the same thing as "Should we do something about that?"

	* Go home English, you're drunk.

		* (Shouldn't that be "drinked")?

---

### I give up

* Speaking of which...

---

## Verb particle constructions

---

### Verb Particle Constructions

When a verb has a different meaning when coupled with a particular preposition or particle

---

### Cut - to slice

* Cut in - To offer somebody a part of a venture

* Cut out - To stop something, or remove somebody from a venture, or lose audio

* Cut with - To adulterate a drug

* Cut off - To cease financial support, or merge leaving too little space

	* ... or remove a smaller part than the whole

* Cut it - To suffice for a task

---

### Cut continued

* Cut up - To slice into small pieces

* Cut down - To shorten something

* Cut across/through - To shorten one's route by traversing an open space

* Cut on - To repeatedly make small cutting strokes at the periphery of an object

* Cut back - To reduce an existing option or investment, travel back in story

---

Sometimes, we don't know if we want the verb particle construction, or the preposition!

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup1.png">

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup2.png">

---

### These differences can have major consequences

---

### "Jackie stole my lunchbox..."

* "... then she threw my lunch up on the roof"

* "... then she threw up my lunch on the roof"

---

### Then there's the really crazy stuff

---

*Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.*

* This is a fully grammatical sentence

	* Buffalo NY, Buffalo (the animal), and the verb "buffalo" (to bully)

* "New York bison whom other New York bison bully, themselves bully New York bison".

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/surprisedbuffalo.jpg">

---

## It's not just English!

---

### English happens to be absolutely insane

* It's filled with irregularities, weirdnesses, odd constructions, and other silliness

* *... but that's no different than any other language.*

---

## All languages are crazy!

* We're simplifying languages left and right for this class

	* Partly because we don't have the time

	* ... and because if we didn't, you'd run screaming

---

### The Real Russian Case System

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/russiancaseendings.gif"> 

---

### Spanish Verbal Hell

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/spanishverbs.jpg">

---

### ... and that craziness is why linguists love language so much!

---

### Wrapping up

* English is bat-poop cray-cray, in so many ways

	* (Partly because you understood that sentence)

* ... but so is every other language

* That's why we love them

* Second language learners are fighting an uphill battle.  Be kind!
