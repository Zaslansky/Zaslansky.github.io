### Questions from last time?

- Analytical techniques don't have to be cognitively real to be useful!

---

# Frequency and Morphology!
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### We've talked about two views on the lexicon

- **Morpheme-based Lexicon:** We're storing chunks of words and recombining them at the time of speech

- **Word-based Lexicon:** We're storing words as chunks, and breaking them apart when we need to

---

### Today, we'll look at something that's closely related to that debate!

---

### Today's Plan

- What is frequency?

- Frequency and Basic Forms

- Frequency and Productivity

- Frequency and Morphological Marking

- Frequency and Oddity

---

# What is Frequency?

---

### Not all words are used with the same frequency

- We use 'to be' much more than 'to defenestrate'

    - (I hope!)
    
- We talk about plural cars more often than plural octopodes

- These distributions are really unequal!

---

### Zipf's Law

- "In a given corpus of natural language, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table"

- *The most common words are **really** common!*

    - ... and the rarest words are super rare

---

<img class="wide" src="morphology/zipf2.jpg">

---

### We find frequency through observation

- "How often does a word occur in natural language?"

- This is often checked using text corpora

---

## Text Corpus

A large body of natural language text collected for linguistic inquiry

---

### Corpora have a bunch of language data

- Brown corpus: One million words

- [EnronSent Corpus](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/enronsent.html): 14 million words

- [OpenANC Corpus](http://www.anc.org/): 15 million words (annotated)

- NY Times corpus: 1.8 million articles

- [Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/): 560 million words

- iWeb Corpus: 14 *billion* words

---

### We can use a corpus to check frequency!

- [COCA Frequency](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/) of 'are': 2,567,146 tokens

- 'walk': 67,178 tokens

- 'walked': 58,702 tokens

- 'scratch': 6,020 tokens

- 'cray': 347 tokens

- 'chamfer': 33 tokens

- 'yeet': 0 tokens

---

### Corpus frequency should have some relation to usage frequency

- Words that almost never show up in large amounts of text are probably quite rare

    - ... or the text isn't representative (c.f. yeet)
    
- We can **calculate and quantify** the relative frequency of words

---

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/coolstoryhouse.jpg">
    
---

### Why does frequency matter for morphology?

---

# Frequency and Basic Forms

---

## What's the most basic form of a word?

---

### Deriving 'basic' from structure

- We've been making an assumption: More morphology makes it 'less basic'

- 'cat' is basic, 'cats' is derived

- 'govern' is basic, 'government' is derived

- 'equal' is basic, 'unequalled' is derived

---

### We can think of this as a structure-based view

- **The base form is the simplest form observed!**

- Modifications to the simplest morphological form result in a derived form!

---

### This doesn't have to be true!

- Some kinds of words *never* surface without additional morphology

    - Think Spanish verbal morphology, which is *obligatory*

- Some words are seldom found without additional morphology

    - 'couth'

- Remember, we might be storing whole words

    - All forms are equivalent in complexity then!
    
---

### Deriving 'basic' from frequency

- Another approach: **The most frequent form is the most basic form!**

    - This is *regardless of form!*
    
- Govern (3,856) vs. <clg>Government (240,841)</clg>

- Settle (13,201) vs. <clg>Settlement (16,394)</clg>

- <clg>Enhance (11,672)</clg> vs. Enhancement (2,548)

---

### These two approaches make different predictions

- 'Govern' is the basic form in a *structure-based* approach

- 'Government' is the basic form in a *frequency-based* approach

---

### Frequency seems to play a role in the lexicon

- The most frequent words are easier and faster to access

- We preferentially hear frequent words in ambiguous situations

- We learn more frequent forms more easily

- Common use makes for stronger mental representation!

- **Frequency is a reasonable way to think about 'basicness'**

---

... but does frequency win us anything else?

---

# Frequency and Productivity

---

## Why are some patterns productive?

---

### plemkal - 'walked'

- glentap - 'cried'

- klampe - 'sung'

- flutap - 'yelled'

- slapte - 'grabbed'

- vlagre - 'wakened'

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### If 'hug' is 'beemte', the word for 'hugged' is...

A) beemtap

B) breemte

C) bleemte

D) veemte

E) wugiz

---

### Gar - 'cat' Garfalb - 'catty'

- Bar - 'noodle' Barfalb - 'noodly'

- Ger - 'rock' Gerfalb - 'rocky'

- Fes - 'sponge' Fesfalb - 'spongey'

- Fest - 'party' Festfalb - 'party-like'

- Ren - 'knight' Renfalb - 'knight-like'

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### If 'dog' is 'rup', the word for 'dog-like' is....

A) Ruplen

B) Ruplab

C) Rupfalb

D) Rupples

E) Rupopodes

---

### We need to see examples of the pattern in action to use it

- Morphological patterns must be 'seen' to be used!

---

### Lexicalization is when we stop 'seeing' the pattern

- 'oxen', 'children', 'brethren', 'women'

- Speakers no longer recognize '-en' as a plural marker

- Words that are never seen die off!

---

### "Do speakers have to see the pattern with a certain frequency for it to stay productive?"

- # Yes!

---

### The 'parsing line'

- The base form needs to be common enough that speakers 'see' the pattern

- Hay and Baayen (2002) describe one way to calculate this

---

### Put simply...

- When the majority of words participating in a morphological pattern are **more frequent** than their bases, then that morphological pattern is *not likely to be productive*

- When the majority of words participating in a morphological pattern are **less frequent** than their bases, then that morphological pattern is *likely to be productive*

- This is referred to as the **parsing ratio**

---

### Parsing Ratio for '-ity'

- Modern/Modernity, Secure/Security, Insane/Insanity

- 17% of complex words containing ity are *less frequent than their bases*

- 83% of complex words containing ity are *more frequent* than their bases

- -ity has a **parsing ratio** of 0.17

- The complex form (with -ity) is more basic!

---

### Parsing Ratios

- -ity has a parsing ratio of 0.17

- -ment has a parsing ratio of 0.24

- -ery has a parsing ratio of 0.34

- -er has a parsing ratio of 0.5

- -like has a parsing ratio of 0.68

- -less has a parsing ratio of 0.86

---

### This isn't a perfect measure, but it does help!

- It shows us why we 'see' some affixes in the pile more than others

- It gives us a way to quantify how 'easy to parse' a new word would be

    - This was a *big* element of the 'productive vs. creative' discussion!
    
- It helps us understand affix (and word!) lexicalization!

---

### What else does Frequency help us with?

---

# Frequency and Marking

---

## How often do we use word forms?

---

### Your book has a great discussion of frequency asymmetries!

- You did the reading, right?

---

### How often do we use different word forms?

- Singulars happen more often than plurals

    - For most nouns!
    
- Subjects happen more often than Objects

    - Every sentence has a subject

- 3rd Person Singular forms are *really* common

---

This combines with another fundamental truth of human language

- # We are lazy as heck

---

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/sleepalldaypartynever.jpg">

---

### We see phonological reduction in frequent words

- Memories vs. Mammaries

- Artillery in and out of the military

- **This is really neat!**

---

### Frequent inflectional forms are less likely to be morphologically marked!

- Singulars happen more often than plurals

    - <danger>So let's mark plurals!</danger>
    
- Subjects happen more often than Objects

    - <danger>So let's mark accusative/ergative!</danger>

- 3rd Person Singular forms are *really* common

    - <danger>Zero all the morphemes!</danger>
  
- This is a general pattern...

---

### Less frequent forms are longer and more complex!

- We see more zero-marking in frequent forms

- We see shorter forms for more frequent inflections

- It's not universal, but it's common!

---

### Frequent meanings are also expressed more clearly

- We see less *syncretism* in frequent forms

    - Where multiple inflectional meanings have the same form

- Frequent meanings are more *differentiated*

    - Marking tends to be more specific for frequent cells!
    
---

### Which brings us to the last topic...

---

# Frequency and Oddity

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></sec<section data-background-color=#708cef></sec<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### What's the past tense form of 'sing'?

A) sing

B) sang

C) sung

D) singed

E) I have no idea

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></sec<section data-background-color=#708cef></sec<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### What's the past tense form of 'ping'?

A) ping

B) pung

C) pang

D) pinged

E) I have no idea

---

### Frequent words are more readily able to be irregular!

- Across languages, verbs like 'be', 'do', 'go', 'come', and 'say' are most likely to have irregular morphology

- English 'to be' has 'am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been'

- Spanish 'ser' ('to be') has se-, fu-, es- allomorphs

---

<img class="wide" src="morphology/zipf2.jpg">

---

### Irregular forms need to be memorized!

- ... and that can only happen when they're regularly encountered

- If speakers rarely encounter an unusual form, the irregular form won't persist

- Children will naturally regularize unusual patterns

    - (unless we correct them out of it!)
    
- **Frequency can protect words from analogical change!**

    - ... and can cement their forms!

### More frequent forms replace (or level) less frequent ones

- If we don't see a word often, we'll assume it works 'like the other words'

- Strange characteristics become less strange

- **Rare and weird words get unweirded!**

---

### So, Frequency is helpful in Morphology!

- It lets us quantify word usage in practice

- It helps us find basic forms

- It helps us understand productivity

- It helps us understand why we mark the things we do

- ... and it keeps words short and irregular

---

### Amber will talk more about frequency in her talk on June 7th!

- It's going to be awesome

---

### For Next Time

- We'll talk about weirdly-shaped words, then wrap up the lexicon!
