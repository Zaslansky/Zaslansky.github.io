### Notes on the Final Exam

- This will look a lot like the midterm, except with more questions

	- ... and more long-answer questions

- It will be cumulative, but weighted towards the post-midterm material

	- To understand the material after the midterm, you sort of need the stuff before

- **Students wanting accommodations should reach out to me ASAP**

# Surgical Treatment of Hearing Loss 

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's talk is a bit different

- The Chapter for this week is amazing

- ... as was the audiogram reading chapter

- You'll want to make sure you read it

- ... and there's no need to repeat the material aloud!

---

### So, today, we'll focus on something the book doesn't discuss as much

- How do we 'fix' some of these issues, for folks who feel they want to

---

### Today's Plan

- Treating Recurring Otitis Media

- Treating Eustachian Tube Dysfunction

- Treating Otosclerosis

- Treating Acoustic Neuroma

- Cochlear Implant Basics and Installations

---

### Will is not an Otolaryngologist!

- Please do not treat this as medical advice :)

---

## Treating Recurring Otitis Media

---

### Review: Otitis Media

- An infection of the middle ear

- Often caused by bad eustachian tubes or inflammation

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

### Treating Otitis Media

- Systemic Antibiotics

- Myringotomy

	- Cutting a hole in the eardrum

- Tympanostomy Tube Installation

---

### Adult Tympanostomy

- Numb the eardrum by using phenol

- Cut a slit in the tympanic membrane

- Insert the tube into the slit

---

### See it in practice

<danger>The below link shows this surgery.  There will be blood.</danger>

---

### Potential Complications

- For kids, general anesthesia

- For adults, moving around

- [Medial Migration of Tympanostomy Tube](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16814404/)

	- Often attributed to negative pressure

- ... and more!

---

## Treating Eustacian Tube Dysfunction

---

### Eustachian Tube Dysfunction

- The Eustachian tube doesn't adequately open

- Chronic ear pressure and otitis media

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/eustachian_tube.jpg">

---

### Eustachian Tube Dilation

- Enter through the nose

- Insert a balloon catheter

- Inflate catheter to expand the opening

- Remove catheter

---

### See it in practice

The below link is a CGI rendering of the procedure

---

### Potential Complications

- Carotid Complications

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_medial.jpg">

---

### Potential Complications

Carotid Complications

- Inability to access the tube

- Overdilated Eustachian tube

---

## Treating Otosclerosis

---

### Otosclerosis

- Abnormal growth and stiffening around the stapes, freezing it in place

- The treatment for this is removal and replacement of the stapes

	- This is a 'stapedectomy'

- Or the removal of everything but the footplate, with a hole made over the oval window for a prosthesis

	- This surgery is referred to as a 'stapedotomy'

---

---

### Complications

- Dislocation of the incus

- Perilymph rupture

- Other conductive hearing loss

---

# Treating Acoustic Neuroma 

<small>With special thanks to Dr. Frank Farokhi</small>

---

### 'Acoustic Neuroma'

- Technically a schwannoma occurring on the 8th nerve 

- Occurs when one type of cell ('Schwann Cells') grows out of control on the 8th nerve

- These can occur spontaneously, or as a symptom of neurofibromatosis

---

### These tumors are generally benign

- They don't 'eat into' the nerve

- They compress the nerve within the range

- Compression hurts bloodflow, which prevents action potentials, leads to demyelination, and damage

- *Once removed, full nerve function can be restored!*

---

### This can occur at any point along the 8th Nerve

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_whole.jpg">

---

### Questions for surgical intervention

- Where is the tumor located?

- Do we have evidence of nerve **damage**, or just compression?

	- Is hearing recoverable?

---

### Different locations call for different treatment approaches

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_whole.jpg">

---

### Radiation Therapy

- Targeted beams of radition to kill the tumor tissue only

- Most often used when the tumor is far from the brain 

---

### The Suboccipital Approach

- Used to preserve hearing

- Go in from the back of the head, pull aside the brain, and pull the tumor

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/suboccipitalapproach.jpg">

### How does this work?

---

### The Translabyrinthine Approach

- "Yeah, hearing's gone already, let's avoid risk to the brain and facial nerve by going in through the cochlea"

- This destroys all hearing in that ear.

---

### How does this work?

---

### Complications

- Roughly all of them

- Facial Nerve Damage

- Damage to the 8th nerve

- Hearing loss due to cochlear damage

---

### There are many more treatments

- ... because there are many more disorders

- But these were an interesting subset of disorders

- With particularly interesting surgical approaches

- ... but one of the most well known surgical interventions is...

---

## Cochlear Implants

---

### Cochlear Implants Intuition

- "Why try to restore the outer ear, middle ear, or organ of corti, when we could just stimulate the spiral ganglion ourselves?"

- "Let's do all the transduction and processing ourselves and just send signals down the nerve electrically via a wire in the cochlea!"

---

### That last part's harder than it looks!

- We could very easily send a binary signal

	- "Bro, there's sound!  It's happening!"

- But how do we get frequency information?

	- The same way that humans do!

---

### CIs take advantage of tonotopic organization!

- The electrode has a series of contact points along its length

- The electrode is inserted into the scala tympani

- Each contact point stimulates a different point along the basilar membrane

- *The brain naturally interprets stimulation from different contact points as frequency differences!*

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

### Cochlear Implants transduce sound into nerve impulses!

- External hardware analyzes incoming sounds

- The sound is broken down into frequency bands

- The CI converts these into electric pulses in different bands

- These bands correspond to signals from channels on the electrode, positioned according to tonotopic organization

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_installed.jpg">

---

### The number of 'channels' is a factor

- "How many electrodes do we have to stimulate the cochlea?"

- You want enough channels to send rich data

	- ... but not so many that they interfere with each other

- This number ranges from 12 to 24 in modern CIs

	- Too few channels is bad, but it's not 'more channels is more good'

---

### Cochlear Implants bypass the entire auditory physiology!

- We don't need a middle ear, because sound is picked up externally

- We don't need OHCs because BM/TM movement doesn't matter

- We don't need IHCs because the transduction's happening externally

- We go straight from the CI's microphone to the spiral ganglion!

---

### Cochlear Implants are very expensive

- There are only three makers, with their devices being roughly equivalent

- They're often done unilaterally

- Costs can range from $30,000-100,000 easily

- ... and installing them is a complicated procedure

---

## Installing Cochlear Implants

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_diagram.jpg">

---

### Installing Cochlear Implants

- Drill a hole into the temporal bone into the middle ear

- Open the round window (generally!)

- Insert the electrode (gently)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_inscala.jpg">

---

### Insertion Depth is a concern!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ci_insertion.jpg">

---

### Different people have different experiences

- Differences in cochlear anatomy

- Damage, malformation, or trauma to the cochlea

- This can affect insertion depth, proximity to nerves, and more

- This is one of the many variables in CI outcomes

---

### Installing CIs, continued

- Tuck the sub-dermal part into a skin pouch

- Fill the drilled hole with grafted tissue

- Stitch them up

---

### Want to see how the surgery works?

<danger>The below link is a link to an actual surgery.  There will be blood and incisions and drilling.  You have been warned.</danger>

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFYvKY8xgUQ>

---

### This isn't a one-time thing

- CI's have a lifetime of around 20 years

	- Most people will need to have this happen again

- Trauma to the cochlea during implantation is Bad™

- Yet another reason why this isn't a 'miracle cure for all Deaf people'

---

## What do the outcomes for CI patients look like?

- Next time!

---

### Wrapping up

- There are many surgical interventions which can be helpful

- This is very fiddly, detailed, and precise work

- CIs are amazing bits of technology

- ... and installing them is very difficult
