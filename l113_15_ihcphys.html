# The Physiology of the IHCs and Nerve Coding

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today, we'll zoom in on the inner hair cells

- They are the final transducer between mechanical movement and nerve impulses

- They are **really** cool

- Our question today is very simple: **How do you turn mechanical movements into nerve firings?**

	- ... and what do those firings look like?

---

### Today's Plan

- What parts of the IHCs are sensitive to movement?

- How does that motion trigger a nerve firing?

- How do those nerve firings represent frequency?

- How do those nerve firings represent amplitude?

---

### Review

---

### When the basilar membrane moves...

- The whole organ of corti moves

- The tectorial membrane moves indepedently

- The OHCs do their amplification and tuning thing

	- Pulling and pushing on the tectorial membrane

---

## What part of the IHCs is sensitive to basilar membrane motion?

---

### How do the IHCs detect this?

- Stereocilia!

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_excitation.jpg">

---

### When the stereocilia bend, the IHCs start to fire

- Either fluid movement or the tectorial membrane can bend the stereocilia

- Maybe both at once!

---

## How does that motion trigger a nerve firing?

---

### Stepping Back

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### The different fluids here are crucial

- Endolymph in the Scala Media has a positive potential (+80mV of K+)

	- There is an abundance of potassium ions in endolymph

- Perilymph in the other two scalae has a neutral potential

	- There are relatively few potassium ions in perilymph

- This sets up the **endocochlear potential**

- This potential is maintained by the stria vascularis

---

### The IHCs occur at the border between these fluids

- The tips and stereocilia are in +80mV of K+ Ions

- The base of the cell is in ~0mV of K+ Ions

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### The cell increases this potential!

- Ion pump structures in the cell wall remove K+ ions

- This results in a **negative** intracellular potential 

- This is also known as *polarization*

---

### So, the inside of the cell has a negative potential 

- ... and the stereocilia are swimming in positive ions!

- This is a potential solution to our problem!!

---

### The Stereocilia are the K+ Gateway to the cell!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc.jpg">

---

### The stereocilia are elaborately linked

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_links.jpg">

Sourced from <https://jcs.biologists.org/content/126/8/1721>

---

### These links are deflected by hair motion

- ... and when the links deflect, ion channels open!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc_tiplink.jpg">

---

### When the ion channels open, the cell *depolarizes*

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc_excitation.jpg">

---

### This triggers the nerves to increase their firing rate!

- Boom!  Transduction!

---

### Even this is a bit of a simplification

- [Lots of work is ongoing to understand the precise mechanisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05314-8)

---

### When the excitation (movement) stops...

- The tip links again block the ion channels

- The cell repolarizes

- The nerves fire at a much decreased rate

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc_excitation.jpg">

---

## So, in summary...

- The **endocochlear potential** is built up and constant

- The Inner Hair Cells have a negative charge

- The Endolymph has a positive charge

- When the stereocilia are deflected by sound, they let in positive ions and depolarize the cell

- The Depolarization triggers increased nerve firings

- This stops when the stereocilia return to rest

---

### So, we know how IHCs detect movement

- This is the same method by which OHCs do their thing!

- ... and what triggers nerves to fire

---

### "How are the IHC nerve firings coding acoustic information?!"

---

### Useful Acoustical Information

- Amplitude?

- Period?

- Frequency?

- Wavelength?

- Phase?

---

### If the world made sense...

- "Frequency is coded by how often the neurons fire"

	- "If the sound is 3500 Hz, then the neuron fires 3500 times per second"

- "Amplitude is coded by how strongly the neurons fire"

	- "Stronger sounds make for stronger discharges"

- **This is super wrong**

---

### The Problem

- These nerve impulses are limited to firing at ~1000 Hz on the high end

	- ... Yet we're hearing up to 20,000Hz

- Neurons have a binary firing pattern

	- "On or Off", no gradience

---

## Frequency Coding in the Auditory Nerve

---

### There are two theories of frequency coding

- Place theory

- Frequency theory

---

### Place theory

- "Uh... doesn't tonotopic organization give us this for free?"

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/basilar_tonotopic.jpg">

---

### It does!

- We know where on the BM is sensitive to what frequencies

- We also know where on the BM each signal is coming from

- So, boom, frequency!

---

### Problems with the Place Theory

- Psychoacoustic Evidence!

	- Evidence from Disordered Hearing

	- Evidence from "Missing Fundamental"

- *Place theory is mostly problematic in low frequencies!*

---

### The Temporal Theory

- "We use neural firing patterns to code frequency **directly**, at every place along the BM"

- "The firing patterns themselves code frequency"

- Also called the 'Frequency theory'

---

### We can't do this directly

- Recall the maximum firing rate is ~1,000 Hz

- We need another method!

---

### Volley Theory

- "Even if one neuron can't encode every peak, all of them can!  Go team!"

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_volley.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_interspike_intervals.jpg">

---

### Phase Locking

- "Neurons tend to fire during the positive phase of the sound"

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_phase_locking.jpg">

---

### Problems with the temporal theory

- ~1000Hz theoretical firing rate limit

- Phase locking stops around 5kHz

- *High frequencies are tough for frequency theory!*

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/whynotboth.jpg">

---

### Place Theory and Temporal Theory are complementary

- Place theory works well in mid-to-high frequencies

- Temporal theory works well in low frequencies!

- *It seems likely that we're using both methods to some extent!*

---

### So how are we likely coding frequency in our perception of sound?

- By noting where on the BM this sound is triggering responses

	- ... and...

- By looking at the pattern of firings to detect periodicity!

---

## Amplitude Coding in the auditory nerve

---

### How do we make binary responses code the full range of intensity we hear?

---

### One easy theory

- "Well, the neuron fires more often when it's being stimulated more"

- But this has major problems!

---

### Problems with firing rate

- Nasty interaction with frequency-of-firing-based frequency perception!

- Nerve firing rates plateau quickly!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_io.jpg">


---

### Two other options

- Recruitment

- Differential Sensitivity

---

### Recruitment!

- As the signal gets stronger, more of the BM moves

- This recruits more neurons to fire

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_intensity_coding.jpg">

---

### Differential Sensitivity

- The last theory assumes that *all neurons respond alike*

- That doesn't have to be true!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_differentialsensitivity.jpg">

---

### If neurons differ in sensitivity, we can get a broader range

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/nerve_combined_sensitivity.jpg">

---

### So, Amplitude is likely coded by increased numbers of neurons firing

- Both because more of the BM is moving

- ... and because some neurons are tuned for different amplitudes

---

### We're not so sure about nerve encoding

---

### This is a special kind of difficult to study

- Nerve response within the temporal bone

- We're nowhere near sure about these mechanisms

	- ... but this is our best guess!

---

### Wrapping up

- The BM moves due to the hydromechanical movements associated with sound entering the cochlea

- The IHCs depolarize when the stereocilia are disturbed

- This causes the neurons to start firing

- We fire in specific patterns to signal differences in frequency

- ... and more neurons fire when there's greater power

	- We think!

---

### Next time

- Balanced coverage of the Vestibular System
