<h1>Phonology for Morphology</h1>
<H3>Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120</h3>

---

### Last week, we discussed Phonologically Conditioned Allomorphy

- "This morpheme could look like X, Y or Z depending on the surrounding sounds"

- Let's do a bit of review on what this looks like

---

### Today's Plan

- How do we write a phonological rule?

- What's the difference between phonology and morphology?

- Why does Morphology need phonology?

- What do you need to know from Phonetics/Phonology to do this class?

- Common phonological processes in morphology

---

# Review: How do we write a phonological rule?

---

### The Basic Format

/Starting State/ -> [Ending State] / [When the transformation happens]

---

### Phonological Rule Format

- "X turns into Y in environment Z"

- ‚ÄúX -> Y‚Äù means ‚ÄúX turns into Y‚Äù

    - -> is an arrow.  -> is just easy to type.

- Then the ‚Äú/‚Äù which means ‚Äúin the environment‚Äù

- Then you add a blank, representing where the sound goes that's getting transformed  ‚Äú__‚Äù

- ... And you position that blank relative to the conditioning environment.

- Adding or removing sounds involves tranforming to or from '√∏'

---

### /Remus Lupin/ -> [Wolf] / [Full moon]

![](img/lupin.jpg)

---

### If /n/ turns to an /≈ã/ before [k]...

- /n/ -> [≈ã]  / __k

- If it happened after [k]...

- /n/ -> [≈ã]  / k__

---

### We won't require formal stating of phonological rules this quarter

- Rules don't need to be stated using features

    - (Although sometimes, it's the best approach)
    
- You will not be graded on the quality or elegance of your phonological argumentation

- But if you're explaining how an alternation works, a quick rule is a great way to do so

---

# Are phonology and morphology doing the same thing?

---

## No.

---

### Linguistics Students often mix up the roles of morphology and phonology

---

### The English Plural

- There are three realizations of the English Plural

- dogs, pubs, rags, dads, bins...

- cats, bucks, cliffs, myths

- dishes, fishes, kisses, pluses, judges

---

### A common mistake among new phonology students is to write rules like this...

- √∏ -> [s] / [plural word] __ 

- √∏ -> [z] / [plural word] [C +voice]__ 

- √∏ -> […™z] / [plural word] [C +strident]__ 

- ### Why is this problematic?

---

### Phonology isn't in the business of modifying meaning

- If adding something changes the meaning of the word, it's morphology's problem

- We don't want to write phonological rules to account for morphological changes

- *Phonology handles sound changes in the fully-constructed word!*

---

### We consider morphology to be a separate process

---

![](img/dogs_at_cards.jpg)

---

### The Process

- "First, we'll choose our stem: /d…ëg/"

- "But we need this to be plural, so we'll also need to add the /s/ suffix.  This gives us /d…ëg+s/"

- "Then, we'll apply our phonological rule, /s/ -> [z] / [C +voice]__"

    - /d…ëg+s/ -> [d…ëgz]

- "This gives us the final surface form, [d…ëgz]"

- See, that wasn't so ruff!

    - ü§£

---

(We'll talk more about this process later, but this works for now)

---

### Phonology and morphology are doing different things

- Morphology builds the words, and phonology adapts the sounds to make the word legal

---

### "Oh, OK, so I can forget everything I learned in 111?!"

- (Nice try)

---

# Why does Morphology need Phonology?

---

## Review: Allomorphs

The multiple forms which a given morpheme can take

---

### Allomorphs are generally *conditioned*

- "This single *underlying* morpheme could show up *on the surface* in one of several ways"

- Phonology is regularly responsible.

- "We'll see one of these variants, *depending on the phonological structure of the base*."

---

### Examples of Allomorphy

- -s, -z, and -…™z are the three *allomorphs* of the English plural

    - They are predictable by knowing the voicing and stridency of the prior C

- -t, -d, and -…™d are the three *allomorphs* of the English past tense

    - They are predictable by knowing the voicing and place of the prior C

- *These allomorphs are the surface result of the application of phonological rules!*

---

### Allomorphs are a *surface* concept

- There is one English plural suffix, but it has three *wholly predictable* allomorphs

    - ... but they are three actual realizations of the plural

- *Even if you can give us the rule(s) that create them, we'll still want you to list the allomorphs!*

---

### So, we need phonology for phonologically-conditioned allomorphy

- ... and guess what: It's *everywhere!*

---

# What do you need to know from Phonology for this class?

---

### Having taken 110 and 111 will help a *lot*

- Your life will be around 30% better in this class if you've already taken LIGN 111

- Everything phonological we'll do in this class will be easier than most of what we did in 111

---

### You'll want to know about basic phonetic/phonological concepts

- Consonants vs. Vowels

- Vowel height, backness, and rounding

- Consonant place, manner, and voicing

- [Syllables and syllabification](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/talks/l111_13_syllables.html#/20)

---

### You'll need to be familiar with the IPA

- You need to know how and why it's organized

- You want to have it close at hand

- <img class="wide" src="phonmedia/ipa_consonants.jpg">

---

### Time spent learning the IPA well will pay off *over and over again*

![](img/bearsrepeating.jpg)

---

### You'll want to be familiar with articulatory thinking

- "Openness" of consonants and sonorance

    - *Why* would a /d/ infix become [z] between vowels?

- "Coarticulation" leading to changes in surrounding sounds

    - *Why* would /k/ be fronted before /i/?

- "Naturalness" of phonological rules and processes

    - If /k/ is becoming [b] before a uvular, that's likely not phonological

---

### If you've not taken 110 OR 111, you're going to have an uphill battle

- We can help in office hours

- It's a great idea to brush up on your IPA *now*

- I can point you towards some books that might help

    - [Dave Odden's Introducing Phonology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/introducing-phonology/33F7A04358A15407E6D73C8AA92D4FD9) is a good one
    
- My [slides for Phonology](http://savethevowels.org/111) are still online

---

### You will often need to "look past" phonology to understand the problems here

- Common phonological problems will obscure your problems!

- We should talk about those!

# Common Phonological Processes in Morphology

---

### Common Phonological Processes in Morphology

- Assimilation
- Epenthesis
- Deletion
- Palatalization
- Metathesis
- Fortition or Lenition
- Harmony
- Neutralization*

---

### What's the opposite of...

- Logical
- Formal
- Variable
- Glorious
- Dependent
- Legal
- Regular
- Mobile
- Proper
- Expensive
- Relevant
- Sufficient
- Correct

---

###  <clb>im-</clb> | <clp>il-</clp> | <clo>ir-</clo> | <clg>i≈ã</clg> | <clr>in-</clr>

<clb>
Mobile<br>
Proper<br>
</clb>

<clo>
Relevant<br>
Regular<br>
</clo>

<clp>
Logical<br>
Legal<br>
</clp>

<clg>
Correct<br>
Glorious<br>
</clg>

<clr>
Sufficient<br>
Dependent<br>
Formal<br>
Variable<br>
Expensive<br>
</clr>

---

###  <clb>im-</clb> | <clp>il-</clp> | <clo>ir-</clo> | <clg>i≈ã</clg> | <clr>in-</clr>


- <clb>im-</clb> before labials

- <clp>il-</clp> before /l/

- <clo>ir-</clo> before /…π/

- <clg>i≈ã</clg> before velars

- <clr>in-</clr> everywhere else

---

### This is Assimilation

- "Take on (some of) the characteristics of a nearby sound"

- Can be partial assimilation ('match this feature')

- ... or total assimilation ('become the same sound')

- **Nasals LOVE to assimilate!**

---

### Epenthesis

- Insert a sound to prevent an awkward combination of sounds

- mod+d -> modded

---

### Deletion

- Remove a sound to prevent an awkward combination of sounds

- in+relevant -> irrelevant

---

### Palatalization

- Palatal sounds often make other sounds palatal

- tree -> 'chree'

---

### Metathesis

- Swap two adjacent sounds around in the word

---

### Metathesis

---

### Fortition or Lenition

- **Fortition**: Making a consonant stronger (i.e. more closed)

    - /s/ -> [t]

- **Lenition**: Making a consonant weaker (i.e. more open)

    - /b/ -> [Œ≤]

---

### Harmony

- Where a feature from one segment spreads through the word

- Often occurs with vowel features (e.g. Turkish, Finnish, Yokuts)

- Can occur with nasality too (usually near Uruguay!)

---

### Turkish exhibits vowel harmony in morphological datasets

- ![](humorimg/hint.jpg)

---

### Neutralization

- This isn't a phonological process, but a result

- When a phonological rule *removes a contrast*

- "This morpheme *doesn't seem to get attached here*"

    - It did attach, but got removed!
    
---

### Zoque

<img class="wide" src="morphology/zoque_neutralization.jpg">

---

### Not all missing affixes are phonological!

- Sometimes, the morpheme isn't attached for lexical reasons
    
- Cat -> Cats

- Deer -> Deer

- Elk -> Elk

- Mouse -> Mice

---

### Wrapping Up

- Phonology and Morphology have different goals

- Morphology needs to 'look past' phonology

- You want to make sure you've got phonological basics for this class

- Understanding common phonological processes will help!
