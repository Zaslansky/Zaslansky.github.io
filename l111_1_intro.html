## Syllabus Stuff which bears repeating

<img src="img/bearsrepeating.jpg"> 

---

### Office Hours Schedule

- FIXME

---

### Syllabus Stuff which bears repeating

* Check your email/Canvas

* Come to office hours.

* The syllabus will change *a lot*!

* **We are here to help!**

---

# Canvas

---

### We're moving to Canvas!

- This will replace TritonEd within a few years

- This is a pilot program

- Let's take a look!

---

# What is this course about?

---

## Phonology

The study of how sounds pattern in Language and languages

---

### Within-Language Phonological Questions

- What sounds differentiate words? (Phonemic Analysis)
    - ... and what do speakers hear as being “the same sound”?

- How do speakers tend to group sounds together? (Natural Classes)

- How do sounds change when combined together? (Phonological Alternations)

- What combinations are “legal” in the language? (Phonotactics)

- How are syllables formed and what kinds of syllables does the language prefer? (Syllable Structure)

- How do we assign stress, pitch, and emphasis? (Metrical Phonology)

---

### Phonological Theory Questions

- What patterns of sound patterns are more and less common around the world? 

- How should we model the sound patterns we see in language?

    - Are we using rules that transform 'underlying' sounds into one another?

    - Are we choosing a form among many which does the fewest things we don't like?

    - Are we just remembering the words we've heard said before, and doing the rest from analogy?

- How do these various approaches handle *real data from real languages*?

    - Do they predict all the things that really happen?

    - Do they predict crazy things that *never* happen?

    - How do they account for exceptions and other weird data?

---

### Phonological Theory, Continued

- How are words represented in our minds? As Phonemes? Phones? Words?

- What information plays a role in our phonological decision making?

- How do we actually make these decisions?

- Can we model phonological decisions using computers or other algorithms?

- Do these theories describe what's happening inside the human mind?

    - Or are they just a tool for describing language?

---

### Phonology is not the same thing as phonetics

- Phoneticians are more concerned with the physical processes of speech

- Articulation, Perception, and the cognitive processes underlying both

- Phonologists are more concerned with the patterns of sound structure in different languages

- Markedness, phonotactics, rules, and cross-linguistic patterns

- We'll talk about the intersection later in the quarter

---

### Phonology is a fascinating theoretical field

- Several long theoretical traditions, which we'll touch on

- Vigorous debate about best practices

    - Not a clear "right answer"

- Vigorous debate about the cognitive realities

- Vigorous debate about the exact nature of the field

- **We're going to touch on theoretical questions throughout the quarter**

---

### Phonology is absolutely *crucial* to getting linguistic work done

- Phonetics offers you a series of ordered phones

- Phones are well and good, but they're *hugely* variable

---

![](img/backing_up.jpg)

---

### You need to account for this variability
    
- ... or else your life is going to be *awful*

---

### That's what we're going to do here

---

## This course is about solving phonological problems

---

### In 10 weeks, you will look at a phonological problem and...

- Know that it's a phonological problem

    - Identify what's changing or unexpected

- Understand how to start looking at and characterizing it

- Use tools from this class to break it down

- Describe the pattern, and form a coherent analysis

- Describe the pattern, and form a *graceful* analysis

---

### ... and failing that...

- You'll now that you've still got a problem

    - ... and that you'll need to go deeper still

---

### We'll give you theoretical tools that will help

- ![](humorimg/dangerous_to_go_alone.jpg)

---

### ... and we'll talk about the strengths and weaknesses of these tools

- As well as some alternative approaches

- Because that's a LOT of fun

---

## There are two main goals

- ### 1) Give you enough phonological knowledge to move past many phonological problems

- ### 2) Show you why phonology is an interesting and worthwhile field to spend your life in

---

# How are we going to accomplish these goals?

---

![](humorimg/data_trumpet.jpg)

---

## Two ways of applying data to your brain

- In-class problem-sets

- Homework assignments

---

### In-class problem sets

- Designed to give you a chance to work with actual data

- We'll be here to help

- You'll also get to help your classmates

    - This a part of the learning process

- Pick a group you want to work with

    - Feel free to float around.

---

### Homework problem sets

- These let you work on problems on your own

- These give us a chance to evaluate your work

- You can discuss these with your classmates

    - But you need to write up your own work, and mention who you've collaborated with

---

### We'll also have in-class discussions, and readings

- Those will help too

- Check the syllabus and watch the lectures for new reading announcements

---

## The data *are* the learning

- So, don't be surprised if we're spending a lot of time there.

---

### One thing I'd like to address...

---

# "Group work!?  Noooooo!!!!!"

---

### Why do group work?

- Wider range of information

- Groups stimulate creativity and alternate solutions

- Discussing topics helps cement learning

- It helps you be involved in decision-making

- You're gonna do group work for the rest of your life

---

### What're the downsides?

- Conformity pressure

- Differing skill and preparation levels

- It takes more time!

---

### Differences among group members is a feature not a bug

- Students who are ahead of the game get to teach 

- Students who in the middle get to mix things up

- Students who are struggling get to learn

- *Always* propose alternatives

---

### How are we going to work this?

- Groups are done by seating

    - ... but we'll mix it up from time to time

- We'll always be wandering

    - Sometimes providing feedback to small groups, sometimes cutting in to talk to all
           
- Groups will have a spokesperson

    - You're welcome to change that around a bit
    
- You'll turn in your group information at the end of class
           
---

### We're trying new things here

- LIGN 111 hasn't been taught quite like this

- Mistakes will be made, optimizations will be made

- The schedule will change (except due dates)

- DO NOT PRINT THE SYLLABUS

---

# This quarter...

- We'll offer you tools to address phonological problems

- We'll give you a chance to use them

- We'll discuss why the tools look like they do

- ... but most of all ...

---

### We'll show you that Phonology's a Phon place to spend your time!

- ![](humorimg/badpundog.jpg)

---

## For Next Time

- Come to class ready to phonologize!

- We'll start thinking about why we tackle these problems in the ways that we do
