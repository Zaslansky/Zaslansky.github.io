# Creating Words and Morphemes
### LIGN 42 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- How are words born?

- How are morphemes born?

- Do morphemes ever die?

- Reanalysis!

---

## How are new words born?

---

### In language, we have lots of processes that form words

- Blending: situationship, croots, mansplain

- Coining: bling, yeet, doggo, uwu, dongle

- Univerbation: cat-and-mouse game, or goodbye

- Clipping: pog, rizz

- Spelling Changes: thicc

---

### Also...

- Acronyms and Initialisms: NASA, WAP, thot, UCSD, UCB

- Borrowings: pupusa, kawaii! 

- New meanings: nerf, body count, cap

- ... and many more

---

### Give me new-ish words!

---

### This describes the moment of creation

- ... but what else needs to happen for a word to be 'real' and usable?

---

### How *widespread* does a word need to be usable?

- We'll think more about this on Wednesday!

---

## How are morphemes born?

---

### Borrowing

- -ation, -ize, -ify from Latin

- uber- from German

- -ito/-ita from Spanish

- Other borrowed morphemes?

---

### Grammaticalization

- 'will' as future marker from Old English 'willan'

- 'we'll' as future marker from 'we will'

	- It's not fully productive yet!

- 'imma head out' from 'I am going to head out'

- 'Let's eat' from 'let us eat'

---

### Compounding is a common

- Compounding takes two existing free words and combines them for a new meaning

	- Laptop, backpack, cellphone, fireplace, lipstick, down bad, fuckboy
	
- Most Compounds have a 'head' which controls the part of speech and part of the meaning

	- Bookkeepers, Light Years (vs. aÃ±os luz), sidestepping, grad school

- Compounding acts like derivation

	- New words are created, and with unpredictable meanings

---

### Compounding meanings can be odd too

- Salad Dressing, Butt Dial, Booty Call, Big Mac, Blowhard, pushover, Hawkeye

- Substitutions feel **very** creative

	- Lapbottom?  Butt text?  Booty Skype?  Little Mac?  Eyestick?
	
---

### Reanalysis

- ... but first...

---

## Do morphemes ever die?

---

### Morphology can become opaque and disappear

- It ceases to be 'segmentable'

	- We no longer realize there's a morpheme there

- -en is no longer a productive plural for English

    - oxen, children, women, \*wugen, \*thoten

- 'Strong verbs' (ablaut) is no longer a productive process

    - sit -> sat, sing -> sang, sting -> stung, ding -> \*dung, yeet -> \*yote
    
---

### This morphology has become 'lexicalized'

- It's not usable morphology, it's 'a word being weird'

- We view 'children' as a quirk of 'child'

- We view 'brethren' as a separate word
    
- We consider 'strong' (ablauted) verbs to be 'irregular'
    
---

### At this point, the affix is fossilized

- You may find it in old words

- Speakers may be vaguely aware of the affix

- It's no longer active

- It is lost to the language

*... and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the morpheme passed out of all knowledge.*

---

## Reanalysis

---

### We're constantly looking for morphemes

- ... and not just in this class!

- People try to make sense of their language

- Kids try to understand 'the moving parts' of what they're learning

- Humans are very good at pattern finding

---

### If we notice a pattern, we'll use it

- Whether that was 'intended' or not!

- "No, older generation, that's analyzeable!"

---

### Resegmentation

---

### Cran-

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/cran.jpg">

---

### This often happens with borrowings

- Pease -> Peas -> Pea

- Statistics -> Statistic

- Burglar -> Burgle

- Tamales -> Tamale

- Euthanasia -> Euthanize

---

### Sometimes, these are modern words

- Babysitter -> Babysit

- Bookkeeper -> Bookkeep

- Dingy -> Dinge

- Mentor -> Mentee

- Taser -> Tase

- Typewriter -> Typewrite

---

### Speakers can differ in their acceptance of these forms

- Uncouth -> Couth?

- Enthusiasm -> Enthuse?

- Disgruntled -> Gruntled?

- Disdained -> Dained?

---

### An affix is born!

- # <clr>Alcohol</clr><clb>ic</clb>

- # <clr>Alc</clr><clb>oholic</clb>

---

### -oholic is now a *productive* affix

- Chocoholic

- Workaholic

- Enchiladaholic

- (Does this mean that Catholics really like cats?)

---

### Arnold Zwicky coined a term for these: 'libfix'

- -burger
- -tard
- -naut
- Cran-
- -gate
- -ussy

---

### Sometimes, old affixes are rediscovered

- Some day, your grandkids will take you to the oven store to buy an ov

---

### What other new morphemes can you think of?

---

### This week, we're going to think about these issues in the meme world?

- When does a new meme become a new meme?

- How readily can we find the parts of a meme?

- How easily can we understand what parts refer to what?

- Does that have a role in reanalysis?

- Does that reflect on how new memes are born?
