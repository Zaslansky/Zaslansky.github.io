# Language is Incredible
### Dr. Will Styler

---

### Using language is the most incredible and complex thing you will ever do

- ... and yet you do it every day, all day

---

### People don't generally see this

- We use language *so often* that it feels 'boring', 'normal' and 'easy'

- We stop seeing the complexity

- We stop seeing how truly bizarre it is

- We stop understanding why people spend lifetimes studying it

---

### So, rather than trying to tell you why language is incredible...

- I'm going to show you, by showing you that your language is very, very weird

- That there is more complexity than most people *ever* notice

- ... and yet it still works so well that it feels 'boring'
	
- **That** is incredible
	
---

### Our plan

- Speech is incredible

- Grammar is incredible

- Meaning is incredible

- Language is incredible

---

## Speech is Incredible

---

### Your writing system is lying to you

- We fought through, though rough boughs coughed.

- Knight

- This thistle

- Unionized

-  Beet, bit, bet, bat, bird, but, bought, board, book, boot, boy, buy, bay, boat

---

### So, let's put the writing system aside!

---

## "Linguistics is the best major ever!"

---

### Your ability to understand speech is even more incredible

---

### Let's listen to some sounds

### Speech is incredible

- It's nothing like our writing system makes us think it is

- It's fluid, continuous, and complex

- We are able to perceive speech despite incredible distortion

- ### The fact that we can create and understand speech ever, at all, is incredible

---

## Grammar is incredible

---

### What do we mean by grammar?

- Linguists have a different definition of grammar than most

---

### 'Grammar' to most people

- They're is a nice park over their.

	- 'That's the wrong form of 'there'!!!

- There ain't much good about our writing system in English irregardless of how you look at it.

	- 'Ain't isn't a real word, and OMG IRREGARDLESS IS BAD!!!'

- **These are what we call 'prescriptive grammar' rules, and they're social constructs, and linguists don't care much about them**

---

### Linguists care about how people *actually use language*

- What rules do speakers of this dialect *tend to follow* when speaking?

- What makes language use *hard to understand* or *ambiguous*?

- How do speakers of different dialects *vary* in terms of the rules they follow?

- **These rules describe how people *actually communicate*, and what makes communication *break down***

---

### Sample Sentences

- I'm happy to present to you today.

- Jessica succulent porch obsession on growing the has an.

- All your base are belong to us.

- Saw the car red

	- This would be perfectly fine in Spanish!

---

### We don't always 'know the rules' of our grammar

- ... but we follow them, even when they're strange

---

### English past tense forms are weird!

- sing -> sang

- ring -> rang

- bring -> brought

- sting -> stung

- ding -> dinged

---

### Are these words 'OK' or 'well formed' English words?

- Quieter

- Unquickliestinger

- Slowest

- Ari won the 2021 track meet, but Juan had a faster time when he won in 2022.

	- **I guess Juan was fastester.**

---

### We can understand a word without it feeling 'right'

- 'fastester' is better than 'unquickliest'

	- ... but it's much worse than 'unlockable'
	
- So, 'grammatical' isn't just 'yes' or 'no'
	
---

### We have similar intuitions about sentences

- Will and Jessica went out for Krispy Kreme.

- Please to be no eatings I are not tasty or nutritious.

- I talked to more people than I recognized them.

- I saw the cute black three cats.

---

### Let's build another sentence gradually and see how it goes

---

### The

---

### The boat

---

### The boat floated

---

### The boat floated down

---

### The boat floated down the

---
### The boat floated down the river

---

### The boat floated down the river sank.

---

### This is a 'Garden path' sentence

- Your brain commits to one potential 'reading' of the sentence

- Then, when you get that last word, your brain crashes

- You have back up and analyze it differently to be able to understand it

- The right pitch, timing, and intonation can make it feel OK

	- "The boat, floated down the river, sank!"


---

### Grammar is incredible

- It's so much more than silly 'grammar rules' from pedants

- We have strong knowledge of what forms should be used when

- We understand that although we have lots of options, we can't always use all of them

- Some of our judgments about language forms are strong and 'black and white'

	- ... but lots of forms can fall into 'gray areas'

- ### We have strong and gradient instincts about how language works, even when we're not aware of it

---

### Yet, when meaning gets weird, those can break down

- Which brings us to our next topic...

---

## Meaning is incredible

---

### You understand what words mean, right?

- # "Truck"

---

### Let's ask a very common question in 2023

- # Are you a robot?

---

### Click on all slides containing a Truck

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_penguin.jpg">

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_semi.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_firetruck.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_elcamino.jpg">

---

### Words have a 'core meaning'

- We call this a 'semantic prototype'

- Yet, many things which aren't quite that still feel like 'truck'

- Word meanings are *gradient*, rather than 'all or nothing'

- ... or maybe you're all just robots

---

### How about a sentence you can understand but don't know the meaning of?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/meet_me_here.jpg">

---

### We also think about *why* people say things

- "Will, who is definitely not Batman, gave a lecture."

- "Dalen sure has been hanging out with Helen a lot lately."

- "I ate some of your donuts"

- "Your watch is gone?  I wonder if Ryan's back in town."

- **We understand what's implied without even thinking about it!**

---

### Meaning is incredible

- Even single words' meanings can be tricky to pin down

- Sentence meaning is easy to understand

	- Except when it isn't
	
- Our knowledge about the world is crucial for understanding

- ... and getting some meaning requires us to make assumptions about the world

- ### We understand language's meaning with incredible nuance, using our knowledge of the world!

---

## All Language is Incredible

---

### *Everybody's* language is amazing to linguists

- There's no such thing as 'good' or 'bad' language

	- Although social situations can dictate 'proper' language use, that's social!

- Nobody speaks 'incorrectly', just differently

- Speakers of different dialects don't have 'bad grammar', they just use a different grammar

- **We believe that all language is valid and fundamentally worthy of study**

---

### ... and the rest of the world's languages are amazing too!

- Different sounds!

- Different word structures!

- Different ways to build sentences!

- Different ways to talk about reality, time, space, and events!

- **Every language is just as capable of describing reality as any other language, but every language does it differently!**

---

### All human languages can teach us *something*

- Every language community can teach us something about how Language works

- No language is 'boring' or 'basic' or 'primitive'

- ... and we as linguists can collaborate with communities to help folks to document, teach, and preserve their linguistic heritage

---

### So, all language is incredible

- Whether formal or informal, prestigious or unrecognized

- Whether new or old, from Dickens or Discord

- Whether acknowledged as language or not

- Signed or Spoken

- Here or anywhere else

- ### Language is Language, no matter the form, and it's all worth celebrating!

---

### One last question...

---

### How is this lecture like an extension cord?

- It has a plug at the end!

---

### You should declare a Linguistics Major or Minor!

- You'll learn how we can make sense of this madness

	- ... and find even more madness!

- LIGN 101 is a great place to start (offered every quarter and over the summer)

- More info at <https://savethevowels.org/lingmajor>

	- Or grab a flier for this afternoon's info session!

- OK, OK, back to the actual point

---

### Using language is the most incredible and complex thing you will ever do

- Speech is shockingly complex, and we don't care

- We're barely aware of our grammar, yet we use it constantly to make fine-grained decisions

- We understand nuanced meanings, informed by our understanding of the world

- Everybody languages, in different, worthwhile, and valid ways, all of which can teach us about Humanity

- Language is worth studying, and a life in language is a life well spent

	- ... because ...
