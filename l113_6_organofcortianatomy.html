# The Anatomy of the Organ of Corti

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- The Organ of Corti

- The Journey of Sound

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### The Basilar membrane moves with sound

- Tonotopically!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_unrolled_wave.jpg">

---

### Vibration doesn't matter unless we can detect it

- We need to 'transduce' the sound from kinetic energy to electrical energy

- That's the role of the organ of corti!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### The Organ of Corti Functions

- *Amplify* sound further

- *Transduce* sound from kinetic to electric energy

- *Transmit* that energy to the brain

---

### Structures within the Organ of Corti

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### The structures we care about

- Dieter and Hensen Cells

- Tectorial Membrane

- The Stria Vascularis

- Outer Hair Cells (OHCs)

- Inner Hair Cells (IHCs)

- 8th Nerve

---

### Deiter's ('Phalangeal') Cells

- Provide structural support for the OHCs

- Not super interesting!

<img src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### Hensen's Cells

- These have some small physiological roles

- They show promise for future research, but we mostly don't care

<img src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### The Stria Vascularis 

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### The Stria Vascularis

- Produces Endolymph

- Has specific cells dedicated to transporting K+ ions into the endolymph

	- More on this later

- This is amazingly important

---

### The Tectorial Membrane

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">


---


## The Tectorial Membrane

- Surprisingly poorly understood

---

### "Wait, why don't we understand how this works?!"

- The Cochlea is a little tiny structure

- Embedded in bone

- Inside a human's head

- Godspeed, researchers

---

### The Tectorial Membrane

- [Seems to play a role in frequency specification and amplification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2856508/)

- Not a great thing when it's missing

- Outer hair cell tips are inside the tectorial membrane

	- ... but not inner hair cells
    
---

### Only the tips of the OHCs are embedded in the Tectorial Membrane!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

## The Outer Hair Cells

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### Outer Hair Cells

- The Outer Hair cells help to *amplify* motion of the basilar membrane

- The cell's length shifts in harmony with the sound

- Preferentially amplifies quiet sounds

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ohc.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_photo.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_top.jpg">

---

### The Outer Hair Cells form the 'cochlear amplifier'

- They're connected to the tectorial membrane

- They help us a *lot* in hearing

---

## The Inner Hair Cells

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

### Inner Hair Cells

- Inner hair cells transduce vibration into electric potential

- These are a *crucial* element of the chain

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hair_ihc.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_top.jpg">

---

### Inner Hair Cells are the last link!

- They turn basilar membrane vibrations into nerve signals

- We'll talk about how in physiology!

---

### Inner hair cells are directly (and richly!) connected to the nervous system

- IHCs are connected to the Spiral Ganglion

- They transmit a train of pulses down the nerves

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_innervation.jpg">

---

### The Sprial Ganglion connects to the cochlear nerve

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_section_nerve.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_interior_netter.jpg">

---

## The Cochlear Nerve

- Also known as the 'Eighth Cranial nerve' or the 'Auditory Nerve' 

- Splits off from the 'Vestibulocochlear Nerve'

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The Vestibulocochlear Nerve connects to the Pons 

<img class="tall" src="hearing/brain_inferior.jpg">

---

### ... and finally, sound has reached the brain!

- In a format it can understand

- The rest is physiological awesomeness

---

## The Journey of Sound

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/corti_crosssection.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_interior_netter.jpg">

---

### A few teaser questions

- "Wait, how do hair cells on top of a membrane trigger nerve firings?"

- "If nerves only send pulses, how do we capture gradient changes in amplitude?"

- "Why do chemicals which build up in the stria vascularis lead to **profound** hearing loss?"

- "Wait, how the heck do you replace the entire organ of corti with an implanted device?"

	 - ... and how do you install it!?!

- **All this and more, later in LIGN 113!**

---

### Next time

- It's on to sound!
