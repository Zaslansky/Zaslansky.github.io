- *This is not what happened*

---

![](humorimg/thisisfine.jpg)

---

### We wanted to be able to keep you all on track

- ... but this is uncharted territory for the department

- But please, understand that some things may be a bit bumpy!

- ![](humorimg/lab_accident.jpg)

---

# Canvas

---

## You need to re-register your clickers in Canvas

- Only this once.

---

- ## YOU NEED TO RE-REGISTER YOUR CLICKERS IN CANVAS

---

# OK, so, what are we studying?

---

## Morphology

The study of how words are constructed in language

---

### Morphology is in a very central place in Linguistics

- ![](img/linguistics_circles.jpg)

---

### Morphology is in a very central place in Linguistics

- Close enough to Phonetics that you still have sound issues

- All up in Phonology's business
    
- It's the gateway to Syntax

- ... and it's often the source of lexical meaning differences in Semantics

---

### You cannot escape Morphology

- If you can't take words apart, words will take *you* apart

---

### Morphology is both theoretical and practical

- "How do words work in Language"

- "How do words work in *this* language"

---

### Because Morphology is *huge* in scope

- There's *so* much to cover that we need to think carefully about what's on the table and not

---

# Learning Goals

---

### In this course, we'll teach you about...

- Morphological Analysis

- Morphological Typology

- Word Creation

- The Lexicon

- The Fuzzy Edges of Word-dom

- How Morphology works in Languages

---

### Morphological Analysis

- How do we look at complete words and their meanings and determine the morphemes present?

- How can you determine the morphological properties of an unknown language?

- What are the best strategies for finding the relationship between a word's form and its meaning?

- What properties of words can carry meaning?

- **How do we solve morphological problems?**

---

### Morphological Typology

- What is a word?

- What kinds of morphemes are found around the world?

- What kinds of morphemes are *common* around the world?

- What *categories* of morphemes are useful to distinguish?

- How does morphology work in different languages?

- How does morphology work in signed languages?

---

### Word Creation

- How are new words formed?

- What's the difference between inflectional and derivational morphology?

- What kinds of word creation processes are *productive* and/or *creative* right now?

- What processes are commonly used when creating new words?

- How do new words get their meanings?

---

### The Lexicon

- How are words stored in the mind?

- What information accompanies words?

- What are we actually storing when we store a word?

- How does this representation affect our speech and language use?

---

### The Fuzzy Edges of Word-dom

- What is a word, anyways?

- Do affixes ever feel like words?

- When does a compound become a word?

- What kind of problems do these expressions cause in analyzing language?

---

## What's out-of-scope for the class?

---

### Topics we're not covering here

- Analyzing phonological alternations

    - Nope.

- Polysynthetic languages

    - Nonopepenopenope.

- Complex templatic morphology

    - NnopeOnopePnopeE.

- Methods for field elicitation of morphology

    - You should take field methods
    
    - OMG you should take field methods
    
---

## Learning Goal Summary

- You'll learn how linguists think words are formed, stored, and created

- You'll learn how to analyze language data to find relationships between word form and meaning

- You'll learn why morphology is just *so* damned cool

---

# How are we going to accomplish these goals?

---

## In-class Presentations

---

### 'Lecture' days

- I'll have a plan and a presentation

- You all will ask questions, and we will have discussions

- Clickers will help us to check knowledge

- *Active learning does not work unless you're active.*

    - Damnit.

---

## Readings

---

### Your book is actually really good

- Haspelmath and Sims *Understanding Morphology*

---

## Language Data

---

![](humorimg/data_trumpet.jpg)

---

### Three ways of applying data to your brain


- Discussion Problems

- Homework assignments

- In-class problem-sets

---

## Discussion Problems

- You'll all have the same problem-set

- You'll work out a (partial) solution on your own, then post it on Canvas

- Then you'll talk with other students about their solutions

- You'll be graded on your effort and the quality of your replies, not the solution *per se*.

- **These replaced four full homeworks**

    - You're welcome ‚ù§
    
---

### Homework problem sets

- These let you work on problems on your own

- These give us a chance to evaluate your work

- You can discuss these with your classmates

    - But you need to write up your own work, and mention who you've collaborated with

---

### In-class Group Analysis

- Designed to give you a chance to work with actual data

- We'll be here to help

- You'll also get to help your classmates

    - This a part of the learning process

- Pick a group you want to work with

    - Feel free to float around.
    
- Sorry about the classroom layout!

---

### One thing I'd like to address...

---

# "Group work!?"

- ![](humorimg/disgusted.jpg)

---

### Why do group work?

- Groups stimulate creativity and alternate solutions

- Discussing topics helps cement learning

- It helps you be involved in decision-making

- You're gonna do group work for the rest of your life

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### LIGN 111 Students: Did you learn a bunch from the group work portions of the class?

A) Yes

B) Eh...

C) No

---

### What're the downsides?

- Conformity pressure

- Differing skill and preparation levels

- It takes more time!

- This lecture hall is gonna be tricky

---

## Sitting in Row G is *banned* on group work days

- This is so we can freely access all groups in this classroom

- We'll remind you, but that's why

---

### We're gonna see how well this works

- Optimizations will be made

- The schedule will change (except due dates)

- DO NOT PRINT THE SYLLABUS

---

# This quarter...

- We'll learn how linguists think words work

- We'll learn the best practices for analyzing words in language data

- We'll delve into a truly wonderful area of linguistics

---

## For Next Time

- Re-Register your clickers in Canvas

- We'll dive into some data
