# Linguistics 113: Hearing Science and Hearing Disorders

### Dr. Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- Questions about class material

- Course Overview

- Your future in hearing science

---

## Questions?

---

## Most interesting/surprising Part of the class?

---

## Course Overview

---

### Sound is everywhere

- We exist in a constant field of air pressure fluctuations

- These fluctuations have periods, frequencies, wavelengths, amplitudes, and phase

---

### We need to know about our environment

- We need to understand the physical world around us

- But our brains are trapped in a vat of fluid in the dark

---

### Hearing turns sound into signal

- Hearing is the process of 'transducing' these fluctuations into useful and usable signal to understand the world

- ... and this happens because...

---

## Hearing Physiology is Amazing

---

### Hearing is a complicated process

- Three different transductions

- Tens of different anatomical elements

- Numerous points of failure

- ... and a variety of mysteries even to modern medicine!

---

### Yet it works!

- OMG hearing works ever at all

- This is AMAZING!

- Treasure every bit of your hearing!

---

## Our hearing works weirdly

---

### We're transducing sound into nerve impulses

- ... but we're not capturing sounds exactly as they are

---

### We hear sound differently than it is

- Sounds can mask our hearing of other sounds

- Our anatomy increases the power of some frequencies

- Our cochlea amplifies the signal further

- Pitch isn't frequency, Loudness isn't amplitude

- Distortions help us to understand their sources and locations

---

### Our hearing is 'flawed' relative to the physics of sounds

- ... but it's flawed for good reasons!

- These distortions focus our attention on the things that matter in our environment

- These distortions define and enable the process of human hearing!

---

### ... but this process is fragile

- Any breakdown in the system can damage our hearing

- ... and damaged hearing can negatively impact many lives

---

## Helping Hearing

---

### Many, many people live with hearing loss

- 2-3 of every 1000 children are born with detectable hearing loss

- ~15% of American adults have some hearing trouble

- 5 out of 6 of children have otitis media by the time they're 3 years old

---

### Audiologists play an important role in helping hearing

- They help to detect hearing pathologies with examinations

- Audiometry helps to characterize the nature of hearing loss

- ... and audiologists coordinate with doctors to address more serious disorders

---

### All of this can help patients identify the best solutions for them

- Perhaps it's just knowledge of the loss, and encouragement towards sign

- Perhaps it's a hearing aid or two

- Maybe there's a surgical intervention that can help

- Maybe even CIs

- Or perhaps the best choice is to focus on living a full life in the deaf community
    
	- ... and focus on a kind of language which suits your strengths

---

### ... but that's not necessarily your path

---

## Your future in hearing science

---

### There are many paths

- You might consider a future in hearing science, audiology or hearing medicine

	- Where you'll work with hearing directly

- You could stay in linguistics, focusing in phonetics and speech perception

	- Where the details of hearing are a crucial part of your work

- Perhaps you'll move on to other spoken language work

	- Where hearing and hearing disorders will be a crucial, if silent, part of your life
    
- ... or maybe you'll go on and do something else altogether

	- But you'll still be listening to the world!
    
---

### I'm still deeply appreciative

- This is a class I've wanted to teach since I've wanted to teach

- You've put in incredible work

- ... I've appreciated your understanding during the bumpy bits

---

### Thank you to Maxine and Vivian!

- They've helped this quarter go smoothly

---

### I hope that you all enjoyed the material

- That you learned a great deal about hearing

- That you'll never have firsthand knowledge of any of these disorders

- That you have a newfound appreciation for a 'boring' sense

- ... and that you're kind to your ears
