# Perspectives on Hearing Science and Hearing Interventions

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### The Plan

- The Clinical Perspective on Hearing Science

- Problematic Ideologies in Hearing Science

- Considering the Deaf perspective and Deaf Culture

- Guidelines for Compassionate Discussion and Care

---

## Hearing Science is a difficult topic for many

- For Deaf people, hearing science can be viewed very skeptically as a field

- ... and the kinds of discussions we're going to have can cause strong emotional reactions

- This is, in part, because of a historical difference in perspective

---

## The 'Clinical Perspective'

---

### For many, 'hearing' is treated as the norm and goal

- Many take a more medical approach, 'restoring towards common function'

- Many talk about 'diagnosing and treating' hearing loss

- And many focus on Cochlear implants and Hearing Aids and their effects on quality of life

---

### This is the clinical perspective

- Many audiologists and otolaryngologists see the world in this way

- Your textbook talks about things this way

- We're going to predominantly talk in this way, to prepare you for the audiological world

- ... and for many hearing people, this feels like an intuitive approach

---

### Hearing Loss feels like a loss to hearing folks!

- Many people view hearing loss as a genuine loss, and want it 'fixed'

- Reduction in their ability to perceive or understand the languages they know

- Loss of ability to hear and attend to environmental sounds

- 'Something I had is gone, and I want it back!'

- Feeling this way is valid, but you need to be careful!

---

### This can lead to a set of problematic perspectives and ideologies

- "Deafness is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be cured"

- "The goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever possible"

- "We should focus on restoring hearing and helping people interact with hearing people using spoken language"

- "Cochlear implants can finally let deaf people hear like normal people!"

- "Anything that can be done to restore any amount of hearing is a good thing!"

---

## Pushing back against these views

---

### These views can be very offensive to many Deaf people

- Not every Deaf person feels this way, and I don't pretend to speak for Deaf culture

- ... but let's look at how these ideologies can be hurtful, and what we can do to be compassionate!

---

### "Deafness is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be cured"

- "Different" isn't the same as 'bad', and many people are perceptually different

- Deafness is a part of many people's personal and cultural identity

- People can lead happy and fulfilling lives with limited or no hearing

---

### "Deafness is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be cured"

- For many Deaf people, this is equivalent to saying that other identities (e.g. race, orientation) can and should also be 'cured'

- **Deaf people are different, but not 'broken' or 'disordered' or in need of a cure**

---

### "The goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever possible"

- This statement removes **agency**, and makes 'hearing' seem like an inherent good

- This also turns Deaf culture and signed language into a 'last resort'

- This also sets up conflicts with, e.g., Deaf parents of a Deaf infant

	- Prescriptive statements like "It's irresponsible not to try to fix your child's hearing"

---

### "The goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever possible"

- Statements like 'We can eliminate deafness through genetic engineering' are often described as feeling 'genocidal' by those in the Deaf community

- **Hearing science can and should research and provide options for those who choose to take them!** 

---

### "We should focus on restoring hearing and helping Deaf people interact with hearing people using spoken language"

- This is an outgrowth of the 'oral language approach' to deaf education, also known as 'oralism'

- "Integrate the Deaf into the hearing world, teach them to speak, to speech-read, restore what hearing you can, and don't bother with sign, most people don't understand it anyways."

---

### "We should focus on restoring hearing and helping Deaf people interact with hearing people using spoken language"

- In some cases, people actively attempt to prevent signing and exposure to sign, which is... not wise.

- The goal of this approach is to make deaf people as functionally similar to hearing people as they can be

	- ... but it's a perspective with a lot of problems!

---

### "We should focus on restoring hearing and helping Deaf people interact with hearing people using spoken language"

- Intelligible speech is difficult for the deaf, speechreading is difficult *and* unreliable

	- c.f. Tyler 1993, "Cochlear Implants and the Deaf Culture", among many others

- Hearing 'restoration' is unreliable at best, and often not sufficient for easy use of spoken language

---

### "We should focus on restoring hearing and helping Deaf people interact with hearing people using spoken language"

- Forcing Deaf people away from the Deaf community and away from Signed language often makes for poor outcomes!

- There is literally no harm to exposing (all!) children to signed language

- **Why push people into a language and culture in which they face difficulties, when signed language and Deaf culture are perfectly suited to their needs?**

---

### "Cochlear implants can finally let deaf people hear like normal people!"

- This is patently false

- CIs are amazing, and can restore some sensation of sound

- CIs can help some people to understand and produce spoken language better

- CI-mediated hearing is *massively* different from natural hearing

- Many children still don't learn spoken language, even with CIs

- **CIs do not magically turn Deaf children into hearing children!**

	- ... and that's a problematic goal!

---

### "Anything that can be done to restore any amount of hearing is a good thing!"

- This deemphasizes the costs of interventions
    
	- Financial costs (e.g. of CIs, hearing aids, training, medical consults)
    
	- Temporal costs (e.g. doctor's visits, insurance claims, speech therapy)
    
	- Physical and medical costs (e.g. massively invasive surgeries and implanted equipment)
    
	- Emotional and Social costs (e.g. time spent 'denying who you are', social disapproval)

- **Limited hearing can certainly be helpful, but the costs can *far* outweigh the benefits**

---

### This is part of the reason you can see some strong pushback in the Deaf community about CIs (especially for kids)

- For some, it's ideological and emotional

	- "Why is expensive and invasive surgery preferable to a child embracing my language and identity?"
    
- For some, it's practical

	- "This often doesn't give good enough outcomes to merit the suffering and costs"
    
- ... and many see it as a matter of choice

	- [Gallaudet University](https://www.gallaudet.edu/) has an audiology program, and does work with CIs and CI technology!
    
---

### There are many views!

- Each person has a different perspective on hearing loss, Deafness and Deaf Culture, and what's best for themselves, their children, and society

- The important thing is understanding!

---

## Guidelines for Compassionate Care in Hearing Science

---

### Remember that hearing loss and deafness mean different things to different people

- For some, lack of hearing can be felt as an intense problem and disability which needs to be fixed

- For others, lack of hearing can be a part of their identity and culture, rather than a disability or 'problem'

- For parents, it can be very scary to learn that your children may not sense the world as you do

	- This is true for both Deaf and hearing parents!
    
- **Don't assume anything about people's perspectives or desires, instead, ask!**
    
---

### Remember that Deaf Culture and Signed languages are very real and very rich 

- The choice is *not* between CIs and a lifetime of solitude

- People can have beautiful and functional language with no hearing at all

- Deaf culture is open to anybody, of any age, and is always a choice

- **Deaf culture and signed languages allow Deaf people to live rich and full lives without *any* medical interventions**

---

### Remember that bilingualism is *not* a problem

- This argument is made over and over again in the US, even with spoken language

- People learn multiple languages in most places around the world and turn out fine

- "Oh no, if you speak [language] around your kids, they'll never learn English!"

	- ... and when you flip over that ideological rock, a lot of ugly bugs come crawling out

---

### Bilingualism is a benefit!

- Children can learn signed languages at the same time they learn spoken languages

- Even if a child or family later decides to attempt a medical intervention, why not start signing now?

- There are no 'cognitive harms' done by learning signed languages and it doesn't make learning English harder

---

### Bilingualism is a benefit!

- Teaching signed language can improve outcomes for Deaf children who later learn spoken languages

	- c.f. Hassanzadeh 2012 "Outcomes of cochlear implantation in deaf children of deaf parents: comparative study"

- **There is no harm in teaching signed languages to children, and there's massive harm from withholding language from children!**

---

### Language deprivation *is* a problem

- If a child has little exposure to signed language while 'waiting to be able to speak and hear', they're being *language deprived*.

	- Language deprivation causes social, emotional, cognitive, and linguistic harm in *all* languages!
    
	- c.f. Humphries et. al 2016 Avoiding Linguistic Neglect of Deaf Children
    
	- Tom Humphries (Dept of Ed. Studies) and Carol Padden (Dean of Social Sciences, Dept of Communication) are UCSD people!

- If hearing interventions fail, or the child struggles to acquire spoken language, they may miss the critical period for language acquisition

	- This could leave the child struggling to be fluent in any language, *signed or spoken*

- **Teaching and using signed language with Deaf children is important, and lack of language does harm!**

---

### Think about what we're discussing in terms of options

- Hearing testing and screening at all ages gives people information to help them make decisions

- Teaching signed language to Deaf and hard of hearing children gives them an immediate option, and helps preserve options for later spoken language use

- Diagnosis and understanding of underlying pathologies gives people a better sense of their reality

- Different interventions have different costs, side effects, effectiveness, and outcomes

---

- **It is your role to help people understand their hearing and their options, so that they can make the right decision *for them*!**

---

### There are many perspectives on hearing science

- ... and it's important to be mindful of your framings, biases, and the consequences of your advice to your clients

- This class (and text) will take a mostly medical view, and focus on restoration and rehabilitation

	- ... but that's for convenience and to reflect the general field
    
- It's crucial to remember that this is a sensitive issue for many people

	- ... and that your advice and perspective can make all the difference, positively, or negatively
    
- ... and ultimately, it's all about offering knowledge and choices!

## For Next Time

- We'll start in on anatomy!
