# Morphology for NLP
### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---


### Today's Plan

- What is morphology?

- What are words made of

- Parts of Speech

- New words

- Word sense and Polysemy

---

# What is Morphology

---

## Morphology

- The study of the shape and formation of words

---

### Words are not monolithic in English

- They're often made of smaller components

- walk vs. walk-ed

- brush vs. brush-ed

- cat vs. cat-s

- show vs. show-s

- The recurring parts are **morphemes**

---

### Morpheme

The smallest piece of a word which expresses a meaning or function

---

### Many words are composed of many morphemes

- *... and each morpheme's meaning contributes to the word's meaning!*

- played (play-ed)
	- play + past tense

- cats (cat-s)
	- cat + plural
	
- blacken (black-en)
	- black + ‘cause to become’
	
- unroll (un-roll)
	- reverse of ‘roll’
	
- older	(old-er)
	- old + ‘comparative’

---

### There are two kinds of morpheme

- Bound, and Free Morphemes

---

### Free Morphemes

- Can stand on their own, do not have to attach to some other form
  
- Cat, Show, Class, Panda, Walk, Purple

---

### Bound Morphemes

- Can’t stand on their own, must be attached to some other morpheme

	- -ed,  -s,  -ing,  -er,  un-, -aholic, twi-, cran-

---

### Bound Morphemes (or 'Affixes')

- **Prefixes** - Go before the root

	- Re-do, Un-screw, Over-come

- **Suffixes** - Go after the root

	- walk-ed, cat-s, end-ing

- There are other kinds, but that's LIGN 120 material!

---

### Morphemes can be tricky for NLP

- Morphology makes the same thing show up in different forms

- "You walk", "She walks", "Marie walked", "San is walking", "Frank's a walker", but "I took three walks"

	- That's six different instances of 'walk', but we want to understand they mean the same thing

- "Three cats", "One cat", "cat-like reflexes", "catnap", but "catastrophe"

- "I see", "She sees.", "I saw the mountain", but "I saw the log in half"

---

### We need to be able to link these things

- We need some way to understand that 'walks' and 'walk' and 'walking' and 'walker' and 'walked' are the same

---

## Stemming
 
'Let's just delete characters from words until all the forms of the word have the same form'

- Will not capture 'see' vs. 'saw' vs. 'sawed' or 'try' vs. 'tried'
	
- Does not understand that 'I saw her' is a different word than 'I bought a saw'
	
- Stemming is *dumb*. It just removes letters according to rules

---

## Lemmatization
	
'Let's examine this word, look at the many morphological forms it can have, and figure out which *lemma* it's a form of.

- Lemmatization requires *knowledge of individual words and their forms*

- Lemmatization is much more accurate than stemming

- Lemmatization is much slower, and requires other resources (like [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/))

---

### You'll want to lemmatize when doing information retrieval

- "takes" and "took" and "take" are all semantically the same

	- You don't want to build a language model separately for all three

- "How long would it take to walk to work?" vs. "How long would walking to work take?"

	- 'walk' is what's important here. 
	
---

### So, those are morphemes

- There are many, *many* kinds of morphemes

- Accomplishing many tasks

- ... and they're the building blocks of *words*

---

# Words

---

### Words are made up of morphemes

- Sometimes just one, sometimes many

- ... but once constructed, words have many different types

---

### Lexical Categories

- Also known as "Parts of Speech"

- The *types* of words which occur in language

---

### Lexical Categories

- **Nouns**: bike, car, cat, dog, tofu, dude, bling

- **Verbs:** go, eat, talk, walk, yeet

- **Adjectives:** lit, sweet, hot, cool, awesome

- **Adverbs:** well, fast, slowly, easily

- **Pre/postpositions:** with, from, on, in

---

### Lexical Categories (Continued)

- **Determiners:** the, a, that, this, those

- **Pronouns:** she, he, him, her, it, I, you, they

- **Conjunctions:** and, or, whenever, while

- **Numeral:** one, twice, third

- **Interjection:** ouch, tsk, damnit!

---

### How do we identify the different parts of speech?

- These generalizations will work for English, but similar ones are available

---

### Nouns

- Describe a person, place or thing

- Can be singular or plural

	- book/books or car/cars, but not quickly/ &#42;quicklys and beg/ &#42;begs
	- red/reds?

- Can be paired with a determiner (e.g. "I like the/a...")

	- I like the book/car/cat/show
	
	- * I like the angry/rotate/beg/quickly

---

### Verbs

- Can take tense marking in English

	- He rotates, she rotated
	- He learns, she learned
	- &#42;He angrys, &#42;He angryed

- Can work with modals

	- I will fly, but &#42;I will angry.
	- I can run, but &#42;I can cat.

---

### Adjectives

- Comparative Constructions

	- Happy/Happier, but &#42;learn/learner
	- Angry/Angrier, but &#42;cat/cater

- Superlative Constructions

	- Mad/Maddest, but &#42;commute/commutest
	- Purple/Purplest, but &#42;penguin/penguinest

- Very/too Constructions

	- Very bad, very angry, very purple, very ugly
	- &#42;Very learn, &#42;Very cat, &#42;Very linguist

---

### There are always some exceptions

- Words can be used as other categories

	- "You look very... linguist today"
	
	- "That's pretty fly"

	- "I can't adult right now"

- Words that don't fit the pattern

	- &#42;She looks much eleganter
	- &#42;I cutted the bush
	- &#42;Three sheeps ran across the path
	
---

### Adverbs are hard

- "the most nebulous and puzzling of the traditional word classes”

 	- (Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985)

- They can modify anything non-nominal

- ![](morphology/adverb_modification.jpg)

---

### There are many flavors of adverbs

- **Temporal**: Now, then, yesterday, always, tomorrow, next week

- **Locative**: Here, there, abroad

- **Sentence**: Perhaps, fortunately, honestly, frankly

- **Manner**: Quickly, carefully, excitedly, beautifully

- **Linking**: Therefore, thus, consequently

- **Degree**: Very, too, extremely


---

### Prepositions

- Indicate a semantic relationship between other entities

	- "Any relationship a squirrel can have with a tree"

	- Under, around, on top of, behind, near, adjacent to, below, above, in, on...

- These don't change form in English

---

### Pronouns

- Substitute for noun phrases

	- "I saw the gal who Kati noticed was carrying a hamster in her backpack"
	
	- "I saw **her**"
	
---

### There are many kinds of pronouns

- Personal Pronouns

	- 1st Person (I, me, mine), 2nd person (You, Yours), 3rd (she/her/hers, he/him/his, them/them/theirs, and others)
	
- Indefinite Pronouns

	- Someone, everybody, nobody, any, anything, something
	
- Interrogative Pronouns

	- "You saw who/what where/when?"
	
- Relative pronouns

	- "I saw the girl **who** knew the cat **that** ate the bird **which** I was watching."
	
- Demonstrative pronouns

	- This, these, that, those
	
---

### Determiners

- Determiners mark and precede nouns

- **The/an** interesting book
- **Those** cookies
- **Which** movie did you see?

- Determiners don't vary in form

---

### Types of Determiners

- **Possessive**: My, your, her, our, his, its, their

- **Demonstrative**: This, these, that, those

- **Interrogative**: which, what, whose

- **Definite**: the

- **Indefinite**: a/an

---

### Conjunctions

- Used to link expressions

- Sunny **and** warm

- Red **or** blue?

- He rolled over **while** I was petting him.

---

### All languages have grammatical categories

- Although the lines between them can be blurrier or cleaner

- ... and some languages don't necessarily use all of them

---

### We'll talk about how to automatically detect Part-of-Speech soon

- ... but for now, know it's there.

---

### We can group these categories into larger sets

- Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs are **content words**

	- A very large set of words, which express new meanings

- Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions are **function words**

	- A small, finite set of words which help combine other words

---

### Content and Function words change differently in languages

- We very rarely gain new **Function words** (Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions)

- We often gain new **Content words** (Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs)

- Function words are a **closed class**, and content words are an **open class**

---

### New function words are pretty rare

- "I didn't see The Island **because** Michael Bay" (new preposition)

- "I spent last night in the library doing homework **slash** looking at pictures of cats" (new conjunction)

---

### New content words are really common

- Simp (Noun/Verb)

- Poggers (Adjective)

- Mid (Adjective)

- Totes (Adverb)

- uwu (Interjection)

---

### ... and existing words can gain new uses

- Flex

- Diamond Hands 

- Tea

- Drop

- Slay

- Facts/Fax

---

### This brings up a major problem for us

- Words can have different 'senses' which are different parts of speech

- These are classically called 'Homonyms'

---

## Homonym

A word which shares the same spoken and written forms, but has a different meaning

- e.g. Bank (river)/Bank (institution), Mug (coffee)/Mug (street robbery), Phone (iPhone)/Phone ([t] or [ŋ])

- This is different from *homophones* (e.g. "banned/band") because the spelling is the same

- This brings up a problem that will haunt us throughout the quarter

---

## Polysemy

The fact that one word can have many different meanings

---

### Word Sense

The specific meaning of a word being used in a given situation

---

### Many words have multple senses

- ... and those senses can have different parts of speech.

---

### Fit

- She fit the package into the over-full trunk

- She's fit to work on your project, given her background

- She's having fits about the new deadline

- She's quite fit for her age

- That fit nicely into my schedule

- She fits in well in San Diego

- Damn, he's *fit*

---

### Speaking of words having different meanings...

- What about when words have different meanings in conjunction?

- "bread chasing"

- "shut down" (vs. "shut up", "shut out", "shut in"...)

- "thank u, next."

- "on the down low"

- "down bad"

---

### Multi-Word Expressions

- When a group of words combine to have a meaning different from their compositional sum

- Similar to an 'idiom', but less rigidly defined.

- These present *huge* problems for NLP

- "I got down low to pet the puppy" vs. "Let's keep this on the down low"

---

### So, written words can have many different parts of speech

- ... and many different meanings indistinguishable by form

- ... and combinations of words can mean something different too

- ... and none of this can be discovered from written form alone

---

---

(Nah, it's OK, we've got syntax)

---

### Wrapping up

- Many words are made of smaller component morphemes

- We need to consider many forms of words, and unite them

- Words are of many different types or 'Parts of speech'

- New words are a regular occurrence

- ... and individual words can mean many different things
