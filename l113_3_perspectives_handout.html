is a difficult topic for many</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For Deaf people, hearing science can be viewed very skeptically
as a field</p></li>
<li><p>… and the kinds of discussions we’re going to have can cause
strong emotional reactions</p></li>
<li><p>This is, in part, because of a historical difference in
perspective</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-clinical-perspective">The ‘Clinical Perspective’</h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="for-many-hearing-is-treated-as-the-norm-and-goal">For many,
‘hearing’ is treated as the norm and goal</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many take a more medical approach, ‘restoring towards common
function’</p></li>
<li><p>Many talk about ‘diagnosing and treating’ hearing loss</p></li>
<li><p>And many focus on Cochlear implants and Hearing Aids and their
effects on quality of life</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="this-is-the-clinical-perspective">This is the clinical
perspective</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many audiologists and otolaryngologists see the world in this
way</p></li>
<li><p>Your textbook talks about things this way</p></li>
<li><p>We’re going to predominantly talk in this way, to prepare you for
the audiological world</p></li>
<li><p>… and for many hearing people, this feels like an intuitive
approach</p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="hearing-loss-feels-like-a-loss-to-hearing-folks">Hearing Loss
feels like a loss to hearing folks!</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Many people view hearing loss as a genuine loss, and want it
‘fixed’</p></li>
<li><p>Reduction in their ability to perceive or understand the
languages they know</p></li>
<li><p>Loss of ability to hear and attend to environmental
sounds</p></li>
<li><p>‘Something I had is gone, and I want it back!’</p></li>

<h3
id="this-can-lead-to-a-set-of-problematic-perspectives-and-ideologies">This
can lead to a set of problematic perspectives and ideologies</h3>

<li><p>“Deafness is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be
cured”</p></li>
<li><p>“The goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever
possible”</p></li>
<li><p>“We should focus on restoring hearing and helping people interact
with hearing people using spoken language”</p></li>

people!”</p></li>

good thing!”</p></li>

<h3 id="these-views-can-be-very-offensive-to-many-deaf-people">These
views can be very offensive to many Deaf people</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Not every Deaf person feels this way, and I don’t pretend to
speak for Deaf culture</p></li>
<li><p>… but let’s look at how these ideologies can be hurtful, and what
we can do to be compassionate!</p></li>

is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be cured”</h3>

perceptually different</p></li>

identity</p></li>

hearing</p></li>

is a disorder and disability which can sometimes be cured”</h3>

identities (e.g. race, orientation) can and should also be
‘cured’</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deaf people are different, but not ‘broken’ or
‘disordered’ or in need of a cure</strong></p></li>

<h3
id="the-goal-of-hearing-science-is-to-fix-hearing-whenever-possible">“The
goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever possible”</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This statement removes <strong>agency</strong>, and makes
‘hearing’ seem like an inherent good</p></li>
<li><p>This also turns Deaf culture and signed language into a ‘last
resort’</p></li>
<li><p>This also sets up conflicts with, e.g., Deaf parents of a Deaf
infant</p>
<ul>
<li>Prescriptive statements like “It’s irresponsible not to try to fix
your child’s hearing”</li>

goal of hearing science is to fix hearing whenever possible”</h3>

engineering’ are often described as feeling ‘genocidal’ by those in the
Deaf community</p></li>

education, also known as ‘oralism’</p></li>
<li><p>“Integrate the Deaf into the hearing world, teach them to speak,
to speech-read, restore what hearing you can, and don’t bother with
sign, most people don’t understand it anyways.”</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>In some cases, people actively attempt to prevent signing and
exposure to sign, which is… not wise.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal of this approach is to make deaf people as functionally
similar to hearing people as they can be</p>

hearing people using spoken language”</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Forcing Deaf people away from the Deaf community and away from
Signed language often makes for poor outcomes!</p></li>
<li><p>There is literally no harm to exposing (all!) children to signed
language</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Why push people into a language and culture in which they
face difficulties, when signed language and Deaf culture are perfectly
suited to their needs?</strong></p></li>

implants can finally let deaf people hear like normal people!”</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This is patently false</p></li>
<li><p>CIs are amazing, and can restore some sensation of sound</p></li>
<li><p>CIs can help some people to understand and produce spoken
language better</p></li>
<li><p>CI-mediated hearing is <em>massively</em> different from natural
hearing</p></li>
<li><p>Many children still don’t learn spoken language, even with
CIs</p></li>
<li><p><strong>CIs do not magically turn Deaf children into hearing
children!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>… and that’s a problematic goal!</li>

<li><p>This deemphasizes the costs of interventions</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Financial costs (e.g. of CIs, hearing aids, training, medical
consults)</p></li>
<li><p>Temporal costs (e.g. doctor’s visits, insurance claims, speech
therapy)</p></li>
<li><p>Physical and medical costs (e.g. massively invasive surgeries and
implanted equipment)</p></li>
<li><p>Emotional and Social costs (e.g. time spent ‘denying who you
are’, social disapproval)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Limited hearing can certainly be helpful, but the costs
can <em>far</em> outweigh the benefits</strong></p></li>

is part of the reason you can see some strong pushback in the Deaf
community about CIs (especially for kids)</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>For some, it’s ideological and emotional</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why is expensive and invasive surgery preferable to a child
embracing my language and identity?”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>For some, it’s practical</p>
<ul>
<li>“This often doesn’t give good enough outcomes to merit the suffering
and costs”</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>… and many see it as a matter of choice</p>

that hearing loss and deafness mean different things to different
people</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>For some, lack of hearing can be felt as an intense problem and
disability which needs to be fixed</p></li>
<li><p>For others, lack of hearing can be a part of their identity and
culture, rather than a disability or ‘problem’</p></li>
<li><p>For parents, it can be very scary to learn that your children may
not sense the world as you do</p>
<ul>
<li>This is true for both Deaf and hearing parents!</li>

solitude</p></li>
<li><p>People can have beautiful and functional language with no hearing
at all</p></li>
<li><p>Deaf culture is open to anybody, of any age, and is always a
choice</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deaf culture and signed languages allow Deaf people to
live rich and full lives without <em>any</em> medical
interventions</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="remember-that-bilingualism-is-not-a-problem">Remember that
bilingualism is <em>not</em> a problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>This argument is made over and over again in the US, even with
spoken language</p></li>
<li><p>People learn multiple languages in most places around the world
and turn out fine</p></li>
<li><p>“Oh no, if you speak [language] around your kids, they’ll never
learn English!”</p>

<h3 id="bilingualism-is-a-benefit">Bilingualism is a benefit!</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Children can learn signed languages at the same time they learn
spoken languages</p></li>
<li><p>Even if a child or family later decides to attempt a medical
intervention, why not start signing now?</p></li>
<li><p>There are no ‘cognitive harms’ done by learning signed languages
and it doesn’t make learning English harder</p></li>

<li><p>Teaching signed language can improve outcomes for Deaf children
who later learn spoken languages</p>

children of deaf parents: comparative study”</li>

<h3 id="language-deprivation-is-a-problem">Language deprivation
<em>is</em> a problem</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>If a child has little exposure to signed language while ‘waiting
to be able to speak and hear’, they’re being <em>language
deprived</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Language deprivation causes social, emotional, cognitive, and
linguistic harm in <em>all</em> languages!</p></li>
<li><p>c.f. Humphries et. al 2016 Avoiding Linguistic Neglect of Deaf
Children</p></li>
<li><p>Tom Humphries (Dept of Ed. Studies) and Carol Padden (Dean of
Social Sciences, Dept of Communication) are UCSD people!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If hearing interventions fail, or the child struggles to acquire
spoken language, they may miss the critical period for language
acquisition</p>
<ul>
<li>This could leave the child struggling to be fluent in any language,
<em>signed or spoken</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Teaching and using signed language with Deaf children is
important, and lack of language does harm!</strong></p></li>

<h3 id="think-about-what-were-discussing-in-terms-of-options">Think
about what we’re discussing in terms of options</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Hearing testing and screening at all ages gives people
information to help them make decisions</p></li>
<li><p>Teaching signed language to Deaf and hard of hearing children
gives them an immediate option, and helps preserve options for later
spoken language use</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnosis and understanding of underlying pathologies gives
people a better sense of their reality</p></li>
<li><p>Different interventions have different costs, side effects,
effectiveness, and outcomes</p></li>

their options, so that they can make the right decision <em>for
them</em>!</strong></li>

the consequences of your advice to your clients</p></li>
<li><p>This class (and text) will take a mostly medical view, and focus
on restoration and rehabilitation</p>
<ul>
<li>… but that’s for convenience and to reflect the general field</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>It’s crucial to remember that this is a sensitive issue for many
people</p>
