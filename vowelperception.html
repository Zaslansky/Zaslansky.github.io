# Vowel Perception is magic

<img class="big" src="img/hogwarts.jpg"> 

### LING 3100 - Will Styler

---

### So, vowel perception is kind of my thing

* My project for this class

* My project for the grad version

* My MA Thesis

* My Prelim

* My Dissertation

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/ohgodwhy.jpeg"> 

---

### Why study vowel perception?

* Because all languages use vowels, and they work similarly everywhere

* Because vowel perception is interestingly complicated

* Because it shows us interesting things about sociolinguistic distinctions and the mind

* Because it’s a great test case for how the brain deals with variation

* ***Because vowels are awesome***

---

### (Yeah, I said it.  Take that, Consonants)

---

What kind of vowels are we talking about?

---

<img src="phonmedia/aeiou.png">

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_english.png"> 

---

### Review: What is a vowel?

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/voweltongue.png"> 

---

### Review: What is a vowel?

A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

* Different resonances *filter* the sound differently and determine the vowel quality

* **Different tongue shapes create different resonances, and different vowels!**

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/voweltongue2.png"> 

---

### What do vowels sound like?

* We talk about vowel quality in terms of "formants"

* These are bands of the spectrum where the energy is strongest

* The frequencies of these formants are our primary cues

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/iformants.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/iformantslabeled.png"> 

---

### Vowel formants

* F1 and F2 are generally considered to be the most important

* F3 is good for rounding and rhoticity

---

### Formants alone can be enough for some perception!

---

# F1

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingf1.mp3"></audio>

---

# F2

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingf2.mp3"></audio>

---

# F3

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingf3.mp3"></audio>

---

## All together now!

---

### What's being said?

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingsine.mp3"></audio>

---

### Here's the original

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingorig.mp3"></audio>

---

### Listen again!

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingsine.mp3"></audio>

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/dudewaitwhat.jpg">

---

### So, vowels are basically formant patterns

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelformants.gif">
<small>Different American English vowels, as spoken by a male speaker</small>  

---

### ... and vowel formants map to articulation!

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/formantsarticulation.png"> 

---

### The IPA chart is acoustic!

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ipaformantsoverlay.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ipaformantsgraph.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/conspiracykeanu.jpg"> 

---

So...

* We listen for formants

* We figure out their frequencies

* Then we know which vowel we’re hearing.

* ### What’s the problem?

---

# Language is crazy

* (In Linguistics, that's *always* the problem)

---

### Why is vowel perception hard?

* Vowel differences are gradient

* Dialect and language variation is everywhere

* Speakers vary from person to person.  *A lot!*

* They also vary from moment-to-moment

---

## Perceptual Gradience

---

### Perceptual Gradience

* You can make an infinite number of tongue shapes causing an infinite number of vowels.

* There's no "alveolar ridge" to give a steady target

* Phonemes have perceptual boundaries

	* Vowels with formant values in between phonemes are rough

* Not all listeners agree on where the boundaries are between, say, /e/ and /ɛ/

---

### Date vs. Debt

---

# Date

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date1.mp3"></audio>

---

# Debt

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date12.mp3"></audio>

---

## ?

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date4.mp3"></audio>

---

## ??

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date8.mp3"></audio>

---

## ???

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date6.mp3"></audio>

---

### Let's do an experiment!

---

## ????

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date_debt_11_steps.mp3"></audio>

---

The first and last sounds have formants like the typical English /eɪ/ and /ɛ/vowels

<img src="phonmedia/datedebtspectrogram.png">

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/date_debt_11_steps.mp3"></audio>

---

... but in the middle, we're not really sure what's going on

<img src="phonmedia/datedebtspectrogram.png">

---

## Language plays a major role in categorization!

---

### Language as a perceptual factor

* The vowel inventory in a language has a strong effect on the perception of vowels

* If you have lots of vowels, each one gets less acoustic elbow room

---

### Spanish

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_spanish.png"> 

---

### English

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_english.png"> 

---

### Swedish

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_swedish.jpg"> 

---

## Speaker Variation!

---

### Speaker Vowel Space Variation

* Different speakers produce different resonances, even for the “same” vowels

	* Vocal tracts can be shorter, longer, wider...

---

<img class="big" src="ling_memes/vocaltract.jpg"> 

---

### Speaker Vowel Space Variation

Different speakers produce different resonances, even for the “same” vowels

* Speaker can have colds or allergies, can have more nasal voices...

* Sociolinguistic factors galore

* Every person has a different set of basic vowel formant positions

	* This is called the speaker’s “vowel space”

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ipaformantsgraph.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_speakeraverages.png"> 

---

### Moment-to-moment Vowel Variation

* Even the same speaker will have variation from moment to moment

* Sometimes we misarticulate, accidentally making the wrong vowel quality

	* Or we talk with food in our mouths, producing different resonances

	* Or sometimes, we’re just plain lazy

* This leads to constant and massive changes in vowel production

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_speakeraverages.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_alltokens.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_alltokensellipses.png"> 

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/trainwreck.png">

---

### Every person you've ever talked with has had different vowel formant patterns

* ... and yet, we understand each other, somehow

---

## See, I told you: Magic

<img class="big" src="img/magic.jpg"> 

---

### How do we accomplish this magic?

---

### Some people try to put the issue aside

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelchart_variation.jpg"> 

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelchart_variation2.jpg"> 

---

### ... but how do we manage perceptually?

---
### Dealing with vowel variability!

* We stack the deck in our favor using the phonology of the language

* We use non-formant-related cues such as vowel length

* We attend to context

* We adjust to individual speakers (or vocal tracts) through Speaker Normalization

* Then, if all else fails, we pretend that we understood, and hope for the best

---

## Dirty Phonological Tricks

---

### Vowel Inventories are designed for perceptibility

* Vowels are spread through the mouth

---

### Spanish

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_spanish.png"> 

---

### English

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_english.png"> 

---

### Swedish

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/vowelcharts_swedish.jpg"> 

---

### Vowel Inventories are designed for perceptibility

Vowels are spread through the mouth

* Languages try to maintain perceptual contrast (to keep things as perceptually unambiguous as possible)

	* /i, e, a, o, u/ more common than /i, y, e, œ, ɛ/

* Contrasts that are tough to hear go away!

* Rounding is used to distinguish vowels which might otherwise be confusable

	* /i, u/ not /y, u/

---

### Vowel Length helps too!

* English tense vowels (/i, e, o, æ, ɔ, ɑ/) are longer than lax vowels (/ɪ, ʊ, ʌ, ɛ/)

<img src="phonmedia/rositzke1939length.png">

<small>Data from Rositske 1939</small>

---

## Context helps!

---

### The Role of Context

* Context helps us to understand words even if the phonemes are acoustically ambiguous

* Easier to understand “Hello” in its normal conversational context

* If you’re not expecting a word, you’ll have to fight harder to understand it.

	* “Hi, John!  Partial Nephrectomy!”

	* “Ohh, Invasive Adenocarcinoma arising in tubulovillious adenoma”

* Nobody runs into rooms and shouts "bat!"

---

## Speaker Normalization

---

### Speaker Normalization

* Every speaker you meet has acoustically different vowels

* We are able to adjust very quickly, and have little trouble with later understanding

* The process by which we adjust is called “Speaker Normalization”

* This process isn’t entirely understood

	* That's a *massive* understatement

---
### History of Normalization

* Differences in absolute vowel qualities were noted very early on

* Two Competing Theories in the 40’s and 50’s:
	
	* Peterson: We identify vowels based on their absolute formant frequencies

	* Joos: We identify vowels based on their relative formant structures

* If Joos is right, then prior context aids in normalization

* Ladefoged and Broadbent set out to test that idea in “Information conveyed by vowels” in 1957

---

### *Information Conveyed by Vowels*

* Ladefoged and Broadbent 1957

* Six versions of an introductory sentence were synthesized, each with different formant structures

* Four test words were synthesized as well

* Listeners heard different combinations of test words and sentences

* *If vowel perception is about absolute frequencies, the prior sentence shouldn't matter!*

---

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_chart2.png"> 
---

# 1957!

---

They had to paint what they wanted on glass

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_glassslide.png"> 

---
Then feed it into an analog sound synthesizer

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_machine.png">

---

### The results weren't too pretty 

---

### Stimulus #4 

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_please4.mp3"></audio>
---
### Stimulus #5

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_please5.mp3"></audio>

---

### Stimulus #6

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_please6.mp3"></audio>

---

... but it worked!

---

### Different contexts led to different perception!

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ladefogedbroadbent/ladefogedbroadbent_graph.png"> 

---

### Ladefoged and Broadbent: Conclusions

> “The linguistic information conveyed by a vowel is largely dependent on the relations between the frequencies of its formants and the formants of other vowels occurring in the same auditory context”

* This set the stage for future work in normalization!

---

## So, uh, how's that work going?

---

We've got two main theories!

---

### Speaker-intrinsic vowel space normalization

* Normalization is a process that “happens”

* You meet somebody, you create a model of their vowel space, and you move on

* These models of speaker vowels are maintained in memory

* One model per person, and a new model each time!

---

### Speaker-extrinsic vowel space normalization

* We store information from *every vowel we hear*!

* Normalization is then just bulk comparison and probability

	* Vowel identities are probabilistically determined

* One might start with an “English” vowels model

* Then, you build a per-speaker exemplar cloud

* Both your per-speaker and overall models change

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_alltokens.png"> 

---

### We don't know which is more accurate!

---

### What do we know about normalization?

* It’s not just about the point vowels (/i, a, u/) as Joos suggested (Verbrugge et. al. 1976)

* Context influences Normalization (as in Ladefoged and Broadbent)

* Knowledge about the speaker (gender, sociolinguistic data) influences normalization (Strand 2000)

* Recent context might be more important than older context (Ciocca, Wong, et al. 2006)

* The normalization process shows up in reaction time during vowel identification tasks (Haggard and Summerfield 1977)

---

### What else do we know about normalization?

* Breath sounds don’t provide good information for normalization, and F0 isn’t a critical factor (Walen & Sheffert 1997)

* More context seems helpful, but only to a certain point (Kakehi 1992)

* We have to normalize to consonants too
	*Some evidence that vowel formants are used to normalize /s/ vs. /ʃ/

* Infants Can normalize to vowels (Kuhl 1979)

* So can dogs (Baru 1975) and Zebra Finches (Ohms et al 2009)

---

These finches are a *major* problem.

---

### Wrapping up

* Formants (F1 & F2) are (still) the primary means of identifying vowels

* Vowel perception is complicated by the enormous variation between speakers and tokens

* Our vowel judgements are affected by the language we speak and by context

* The phonology helps make things perceptually easier

* Vowel charts, although well-intentioned, are dirty, dirty abstractions

* Vowel perception is basically magic
