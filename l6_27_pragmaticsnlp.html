# Pragmatics for NLP
### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---

### Today's Plan

- What is Pragmatics?

- Grice and the Cooperative Principle

- Implicature

- Deixis

---

### We've been talking about meaning in isolation

- "What does this verb mean, *everywhere*?"

- "What is *always* true about the relation between "up" and "down"?"

- "What is *always* true about Y, given X?"

---

### ... but words mean something different in context

- "Can you see?"

- "I'm open"

- "Take that"

- "I feel you"

---

### When meaning stops being about the word and starts being about the situation, we've entered the land of...

---

# Pragmatics

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in a discourse context

---

### Pragmatics is contextual

- It considers the current conversation

- It assumes things about the current world

- It uses elements of our situation to 'fill in the blanks'

---

### Everything in pragmatics flows from the idea of discourse

- Conversation and linguistic interaction

- We have conversations with goals in mind

	- Social goals
	
	- Practical goals
	
	- Informational goals

- ... and we assume some cooperation

---

### The "Cooperative Principle" helps us accomplish these goals

- "I will try to act in such a way as to help the exchange of information, rather than hinder it"

- This is not a rule in the sense of grammatical rules, but a guiding principles

- It can be broken down into four maxims, developed by H. Paul Grice

- **Few things anger humans faster than uncooperative systems!**

---

# Gricean Maxims

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

- Do not say things you believe to be false

- Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

- Be as informative as required, but not more so

- It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

- Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

- Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

- Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

- Avoid unnecessary wordyness

	- Quantity is about too much info, Manner is about too many words for too little info

- Organize your thoughts

---

### Let's test this...

*Alexa, how long does it take to drive from UCSD to UCLA?* 

- (About two hours)

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

Do not say things you believe to be false

Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

Be as informative as required, but not more so

It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

Avoid unnecessary wordyness

Organize your thoughts

---


### We assume people are following these maxims

- It allows us to get a lot more done.

	- Less confirmation, clarification

	- More efficiency

---

### Violating a maxim

- *Actually being uncooperative* by failing to follow these guidelines

- Violating maxims actually messes up conversations

---

### Flouting a Maxim

- Intentionally violating a maxim *in a way that the listener can detect* to express a specific meaning

- This *carries meaning* in the conversation

- It can have great comedic effect

- Unless it's undetected, the conversation is not messed up at all

---

### Examples of Maxim Flouting

- "Oh, yes, Taco Bell is truly gourmet cuisine" (it is clearly not)

- "Is this going to be on the test?" "That's a good question."

- "How does my hair look?" "We haven't been to a cat show in a while."

---

## Grice and NLP

---

### We don't just need these maxims for humans

- Each and every Gricean maxim is in play for Human-Computer Interaction

- Violations of the maxim on either side are problematic

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

- How is this useful when Siri's talking?

- How is this useful when talking to Siri?

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

- How is this useful when Siri's talking?

- How is this useful when talking to Siri?

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

- How is this useful when Siri's talking?

- How is this useful when talking to Siri?

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

- How is this useful when Siri's talking?

- How is this useful when talking to Siri?

---

# Maxims and Meaning

---

### These maxims affect meaning

- "John was alone in the room... or so he believed"

- "Karl, who was absolutely not a lizard-person, went to the store"

- "Marvin left at 5:44 and 30 seconds."

- "Did Ramchand ever work with Sam?" "He hates dogs."

- "Did Sarah buy chicken?" "I think so".

---

### Conversational Implicature

What is suggested, but not expressed or entailed, by an utterance.

- As a listener, you "draw an implicature" from a statement.

---

### "Mary finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" implies that...

- Mary didn't have one before
	
- She'd needed one for a long time
	
- Her computer wasn't backed up

- Mary owns a computer
	
---

###  "Mary finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" *does not* imply that...

- Mary is Icelandic

- Mary owns a Mac

- She went to Costco for the hard drive

- ... everything else

---

### Implicatures do not need to be true in every situation

---

### "Mary finally bought a hard drive to back up her computer" implies that...

- Mary didn't have one before
	
- She'd needed one for a long time
	
- Her computer wasn't backed up

- Mary owns a computer
	
---

### Implicatures are possible *because* of the Cooperative Principle

- We can draw implicatures because we think people are cooperating

- We are trying to find a way that the other person's phrasing is in accordance with the maxims

---

### Sample implicatures

- "Ian and Steven sure have been hanging out a lot"

- "CAPS is just down the way in Gailbraith Hall"

- "Was this before or after your conviction for armed robbery?"

- "Lots of folks wear deodorant"

- "Alexa, make me leave at 4:58"

---

### Implicatures depend on the maxims to work

---

### "Robert might have eaten the cookie"

- Implies that the speaker is unsure whether Robert ate the cookie.

- If the cookie is known to have been eaten by Robert, this is a Quality violation.

---

### "Bub ate some of the cat treats"

- Implies Bub didn't eat them all

	- This is called a "scalar implicature"

- If she did, this statement is a Quantity violation

---

### "John, who is 100% not a lizard person, is coming to dinner"

- Implies that John might, in fact, be a lizard person

- If he is not, this statement is a Relevance violation

---

### "Who do you think stole the cookie?" "I heard Robert was in town"

- Implies reason to believe that Robert might have stolen the cookie

- If not, this statement is a Relevance violation

---

### Implicature is important

- It's everywhere!

- It can be intentional or unintentional

- They can even be deceptive

---

### Implicature is *hard* for NLP

- It requires you to understand the maxims, *then* act accordingly

- We'll solve *many* problems before we solve this one.

---

### There's one more contextual phenomenon we have to worry about

---

## Deictic Words

Words whose meaning depends on the conversational context

---

### Types of Deictic Words

- Pronouns: Me, Us, Him, Her, It, Them

- Temporal Expressions: Today, Next Month, Now, Then, Soon

- Locatives: Here, there, close, across the street

- Demonstratives: This, That, The other, those

---

### Find the Deictic Words

A) "Rick and Graham had their wedding there."

B) "I'm not sure who you're talking about."

C) "Mahesh will see to it next week."

D) "Sally took the students out to dinner at a Sushi restaurant."

E) "John saw a coffee shop across the parking lot."

---

### Deictic Expressions need context to be understood

- This is a big problem in natural language processing

- "Jian will meet you here."

- "Ron scheduled her for two weeks out"

- "She'll need to come back for a consult shortly"

- "Mark's parked across the street from there."

---

### Remember TIMEX normalization?  Anaphora?

- Yep, deixis.

- We're doing deixis all over the place in NLP!

---

### Sometimes, the deixis is implied but not explicit

- "What's the temperature?" (Here)

- "What's my last appointment?" (Today)

- "Set a Lyft to pick me up" (at the nearest street)

- "Turn off the lights" (now)

---

### We'll talk about the discourse context next time

- "The cat will win the show for sure"

---

### Wrapping up

- NLP needs to understand both meaning, and meaning in context

- Gricean Maxims help virtual assistants interact with us properly

- Implicature is *really* difficult, but pretty important

- Deixis needs to be understood

---

### For Next Time

- How do we actually want to design these systems to interact with us?
