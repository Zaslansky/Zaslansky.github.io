# Audiological Testing

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Follow-up: On that pesky TM perforation

---

### Now we're heading into the clinical world

- "How can we evaluate hearing?"

- "How can we characterize different hearing conditions in a numerical way?"

- "How can we help people who want to hear better to hear better?"

---

### The first step is audiological testing!

---

### Today's Plan

- Pure-tone Audiometry

- Speech Audiometry

- Otoscopy

- Tympanometry

- Acoustic Reflex Measurement

- Auditory Brain Stem Response

---

## Pure-tone audiometry

- Measures the amplitude required to hear a "pure tone" at a variety of frequencies.

	- Pure tones are simple waves, not complex

- "Press the button when you hear a beep"

- Can be done with or without masking

- This is a *subjective*, behavioral test

- *We'll focus on this in our next session!*

---

## Speech Audiometry

- Measures the amplitude required to understand speech!

- "Repeat each word you say back to me"

- Again can be done with or without masking

- Also *subjective* and behavioral

- *Also in our next session!*

---

## Visual Inspection (Otoscopy)

---

### This is easy, quick and cheap

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscope.jpg">

---

### Let's look inside the ear canal and check for...

---

### A clean, happy ear canal

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscopy_normal.jpg">

---

### Otitis Media

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otitis_media.jpg">

---

### Built up wax

(Go ahead and google that yourself, it's not pretty)

---

### A visible perforation of the TM

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscopy_perf.jpg">

---

### Tympanostomy Tubes

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscopy_tube.jpg">

---

### Effusion (Fluid Build-up)

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscopy_effusion.jpg">

---

### Cholesteatoma

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/otoscopy_cholesteatoma.jpg">

---

### A foreign object

- Yep, you can google this one too

---

### What conductive losses would this *not* reveal?

---

## Tympanometry

---

### Tympanometry measures the function of the middle ear

- "Is it taking in sound?"

- "Is the tympanic membrane moving as expected?"

- "Is the pressure inside the ear what we'd expect?"

- This is an 'objective' test

	- It doesn't rely on conscious information from the patient

---

### Tympanometry measures 'admittance'

- Admittance is the opposite of impedance

	- It's measured in 'mhos' (which are the opposite of ohms) ðŸ¤£

- "I'm going to play a 226Hz tone at 85dB into the ear, let's see how much is pulled into the middle ear"

	- Involves simultaneous playback and measurement

- We can compare the amount of admittance to known normal values

---

### Admittance Intuition

- Misty Golfing

---

### Tympanometry looks at admittance under different pressure levels

- We expect the middle ear to absorb energy best at atmospheric pressure

	- ... and when the pressures are too high or low, for admittance to go down

- So, you 'sweep' the pressure while measuring admittance!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_diagram.jpg">

---

### A 'normal' tympanogram

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_normal.jpg">

---

### Tympanograms with troubles

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_perf.jpg">

---

### Reduced Admittance (Type As)

- Poor movement of the tympanic membrane!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_as.jpg">

---

### High Admittance (Type Ad or Add)

- Excessively mobile TM (e.g. busted/dislocated ossicles or thinned TM)

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_ad.jpg">

---

### Flat (Type B)

- OM with effusion, perforation, or tubes

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_b.jpg">

---

### Negative Pressure (Type C)

- Middle ear pressure hasn't equalized, bad eustachian tube!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanogram_c.jpg">

---

### Tympanograms provide valuable information!

- They tell us about middle ear and ossicular function

- They tell us about pressure inside the ear

- They tell us about TM health

- They provide more information for diagnosing hearing trouble!

---

### What does this tell us about sensorineural loss?

---

### These four tests almost always happen!

- Otoscopy, Pure-tone Audiometry, Speech Audiometry, and Tympanography

- ... but sometimes you need more data!

---

## Acoustic Reflex Measurement

---

### Review

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_lateral.jpg">

---

### We can measure admittance

- "How much sound energy is being allowed to pass down the chain"

- The acoustic reflex should change the admittance!

	- Keeping the ossicles from moving as effectively will make them transmit less sound

---

### Acoustic Reflex Measurement triggers the AR on purpose!

- Play a series of escalating tones into one ear or the other

- Then measure the level at which we see the AR happen!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/acousticreflex_measure.jpg">

---

### We can measure both the strength of the AR

- We can measure the threshold which triggers it

- ... and we can measure same ear (ipsilateral) and opposite ear (contralateral) reflexes!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/acousticreflex_chart.jpg">

---

### Acoustic Reflex Measurement provides great diagnostic info!

- Helps to distinguish different nerve disorders

---

### There's way more to this than we have time for

- Mostly, just realize that it's a thing!

---

## OAEs and ABRs!

---

### Sometimes, you can't rely on cooperation

- Children, Infants, Newborns

- Potentially non-cooperative adult patients

	- Worker's Comp and/or Disability fraud cases

- ... or the patient has troubles that aren't well captured by other measures

- We might want to look for *evoked responses*

	- Don't ask the patient, just measure their physiological response

---

### Otoacoustic Emissions

- We've talked about these already

- "Play a sound into the cochlea, and listen for what comes back!"

- They help measure the health of the cochlear amplifier

- Chapter 11 of your book goes into depth

---

### OAEs have a blind spot!

- What could be missing with OAEs still working well?

---

### Auditory Brainstem Response

- Sometimes, you suspect there's a nerve problem

- Or maybe you can't get *subjective*, behavioral measurements

	- Children, Infants, Newborns

- But you still want more detailed information than OAEs

---

### The idea

- Present auditory stimulus repeatedly

- Look for evidence of neural activity by measuring scalp potentials

- Use signal averaging to isolate the responses which are *time locked* to the stimulus

---

### ABRs by Amplitude

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/abr_intensity.jpg">

---

### ABRs by Frequency

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/abr_frequency.jpg">

---

### ABRs can give us lots of information

- It can give us thresholds of perception

	- Audiogram-like data, without cooperation!

- It can identify pathologies of the 8th nerve

- It's yet another window into hearing function!

- **These are covered in more depth in Chapter 11!**

---

### Wrapping Up

- Audiological tests provide useful information for diagnosing pathologies

- They can give direct information

	- Otoscopy

- They can give us subjective, behavioral information

	- Audiometry

- They can give us objective information about the systems

	- Tympanography, Auditory Reflex Testing, OAEs and ABRs

- They're all awesome!
