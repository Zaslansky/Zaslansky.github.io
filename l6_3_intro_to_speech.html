# Introduction to Speech 

### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---
			  
### Today's Plan

- How does speech work?

- How can we write down speech?

- How do we describe consonants?

- How do we describe vowels?

---

### An Apology

- Dearest LIGN 101 Students: This will be very familiar to many of you

- Hopefully the review will help, or failing that, you'll be ready to help your classmates

---

## How does speech work?

---

### The Speech Process

* Flapping bits of meat inside your head while blowing out air

* This creates vibrations in the air you're expelling

* The ear picks these up, and inteprets them as speech.

* This process is studied in **Phonetics**

---

### The Lungs

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/lungs.jpg">

---

### Flapping bits of meat ("articulation")

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/nasalsagittal.jpg"> 

---

### Simplified a bit...

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittal_simple.jpg">

---

### The Tongue

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/tonguefromside.jpg">

---

<video class="r-stretch" controls src="video/mri_joynash.mp4"></video>

---

### Let's do an experiment

---

> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.

---

### Speech is absolutely insane

- It's a series of fluid and overlapping gestures

- It's amazingly complex

- ... and it's nothing like we think it is

---

### How do we wrap our heads around it?

- First, we break speech into 'segments' or 'phones'

- Then, we figure out how to describe those phones and their properties

- This lets us *transcribe* what was said, rather than what words were said

- But first you need to realize that...

---

## Your writing system is a trainwreck

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/trainwreck.png">

---

### Your writing system is lying to you

- Every minute of every day

	- "They thoroughly and roughly wrought the boughs in the borough, through and through"
	
	- C doesn't exist
	
	- TH is neither a t nor an h, and represents two different sounds

- ... and if you start thinking about letters, you're going to start struggling

- For this class, consider your writing system with the same skepticism you would normally reserve for a guy with a broken bottle walking towards you in a dark alley.

---

### We have a problem

- To work with speech, we need to understand what's being said

	- Both to generate it, and to record it

- The Writing System Sucks so badly that it's almost useless for this task

- We need a way to **transcribe** speech, rather than writing down the words being said

---

### Phonetic Alphabets

- A system for *transcribing* the individual speech sounds that were made, rather than the words being produced

- These can be language specific, or international

- You throw away the writing system, and write down the *sequence of sounds* being produced

---

### The International Phonetic Alphabet

 - A system for transcription that's based on *describing* individual phones

 - The IPA should be able to transcribe speech in *any* human language or dialect

---
	
### The IPA allows us to 'transcribe' speech

- "Black Lives Matter"

- In Will's dialect: /blæk lajvz mæɾəɹ/

	- Note the /z/, and the /ɾ/ tap, and the lack of "c"

---

### There are other phonetic alphabets used for Speech Recognition

- Notably [ARPABET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPABET)

	- Designed to allow speech transcription of English without relying on IPA fonts and encoding
	
- ARPABET uses two character combinations to encode the sounds of *English*

	- AAA R P AX B EH T / Y UW Z IH Z / T UW / K EH R IH K T ER ...
	
- X-SAMPA is a similar idea, but full IPA

- We're going to focus on the IPA here, because it's most useful for learning how speech works

---
	
### To understand transcription, you need to understand how sounds work
	
- So... how do we describe how speech sounds are made?

---

### We break the world into two kinds of speech sounds

- **Consonants:** Constrict, obstruct, or divert air in the vocal tract when being produced

- **Vowels:** Shape the (unobstructed) vocal tract to change the sound emitted

---

## Describing Consonants

---
### Three steps to describing Consonants

* We need to know three things:

* **Place**: Where is the sound made?

* **Manner**: What are we doing there?

* **Voicing**: Are we making voicing?

---

## Place

---

### Place of Articulation

- Where is the sound being made?

---
### Place

---

### Place

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittal_labeled.png"> 

---

### Place

* **Bilabial**: As in "***b***oy"

* **Labiodental**: As in "***V***ote"

* **Interdental**: As in "***Th***ose"

* **Alveolar**: As in "***T***o***t***e***s***!"

	- Your alveolars may be *dental*

* **Postalveolar**: As in "***J***u***dge***"
	- Your reading called these 'palatal'

* **Velar**: As in "Ta***c***o***c***at"

* **Glottal**: As in "Uh***-***oh!"	

- **Give me a word which...**
	
---
	
### There are other places English doesn't use

- 'Uvular' sounds are made involving the uvula

	- As Cardi B says, 'that little dangly thang that swang in the back of my throat'

	- The French "r" sound in 'rouge'

- 'Retroflex' sounds curl the tongue up and back

	- Present in Hindi/Urdu, as well as many other languages!

## Manner of Articulation

---

### Manner

"So what are you doing with the articulators?"

---

### Manner

* **Stops**: Stop the airflow (also called 'plosives')
	- As in '**c**a**t** **d**o**ck**e**t**'

* ***Taps***: Throw your tongue against the roof of your mouth
	- As in 'la**t**er la**dd**er wi**nn**ers'

* **Fricatives**: Constrict the airflow to make sounds

	- As in '**f**la**sh**y **s**o**v**iet **sh**i**f**ter**s**'

* **Nasals**: Channel the air out the nose

	- As in 'wi**ng** **m**a**n** '

### Nasal Stop (/n/)
	
<video data-autoplay  width="600" src="ipa/voiced_bilabial_nasal.mp4"></video>

---


### Manner (Continued)

* **Approximants**: Bring the tongue *toward* the place

	- As in '**y**ou **w**ill'

* **Laterals**: Channel air *around* the tongue

	- As in '**l**atera**l**s'


---

## Voicing

---

### Voicing

* Is the larynx buzzing, or not?

---

### Let's pretend we're snakes eating bees!

<img  class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/snakesbees.jpg"> 

---

### Voiced vs. Voiceless

- Cats
- Bob
- Month
- Those
- Crash
- Judge

---

### Three steps to describing Consonants

* We need to know three things:

* **Place**: Where is the sound made?

* **Manner**: What are we doing there?

* **Voicing**: Are we making voicing?

---

### All consonants can be described this way

- /m/ - Voiced Bilabial Nasal

- /t/ - Voiceless Alveolar Stop

- /g/ - Voiced Velar Stop

- /f/ - Voiceless Labiodental Fricative

---

### There are a couple of weird ones

- /ɹ/ - The English "R", a voiced 'alveolar' approximant
	- "Reed read the wrong resolution"
	- Super weird

- /w/ - A voiced labio-velar approximant
	- "Will would wisely watch the wind"
	- Has a voiceless version ("Cool whip" from Family Guy)

---
			  
### 'Affricates'

If you combine a fricative and a stop, you get an affricate

- **J**u**dg**e (dʒʌdʒ)

- **Ch**eese (tʃiz)

- Ca**ts** (kæts)

---

### So, that's consonants.

---

## Vowels!

---

### Vowels are created by shaping your vocal tract

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---


<img  class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue.png"> 

---

### Vowels are different from consonants

- They're always* voiced

- They can (and do) occur on their own. I.

- We describe vowels using different characteristics

---

### How many vowels are present in Mainstream US English?

A) 5

B) 5, sometimes 6

C) 12

D) 17

E) 21

### / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, əɹ, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- beet
- bit
- bet
- bat
- sof**a**
- bird
- but
- bot
- bought
- book
- boot

---

/i/ - beet, see, seen, sear, seal

/ɪ/ - bit, sit, tin, sill

/ɛ/ - bet, set, sent, fair, sell

/æ/ - bat, sat, pant, pal

/ʌ/ - but, sun, pun, lull (ə in sofa, amount)

/əɹ/ - bird, purr, earl, butter, clamor (this is often broken into two vowels!)

/ɑ/ - bot, saw, star, paul, pawn, (cot*)

/ɔ/ - corn /kɔɹn/, boy /bɔj/ (caught*)

/ʊ/ - book, hood, puss

/u/ - boot, who’d, loose, lure, loon

---

### Describing Vowels

- For vowels, we talk about three additional dimensions

- 1- Where is the tongue in terms of height?
  - (High, Low, or Mid)
  - Also "Closed, Open, or Mid"

- 2- Where is the tongue in terms of horizontal space?
  - (Front, Central, or Back)

- 3- Are your lips rounded or not?

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_vowels_with_tongue.jpg">

---

### Diphthongs

- Vowels where the tongue moves through the mouth

- Start at one vowel, move to another vowel

- Things like “boy” (/ɔj/), “buy” (/aj/), “bay” (/ej/), “boat” (/ow/), “cow” (/aw/)

- Others are monophthongs

---

### MUSE Diphthongs

/ɔj/ - boy, soy, toy, join, oil, Roy

/aj/ - buy, right, try, sigh, die, fire

/ej/ - play, bay, may, ray, lay, trail

/ow/ - boat, oat, wrote, pope, toll

/aw/ - how, now, brown, cow, prow, louse

---

### So, Mainstream US English has lots of vowels

- 12 Monophthongs

	- / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, ɜ˞, ə˞, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- 5 Diphthongs

	- /ɔj, aj, ej, ow, aw/

- And we describe these vowels in terms of high-to-low, front-to-back, and rounded or not. 

---

### So, that's how we describe consonants and vowels

- Now we understand that speech is different from writing

- We need to be able to *transcribe* and *describe* speech in order to be able to manipulate and create it

---

### Wrapping it up

- Speech is crazy complicated

- The English writing system is a large lagoon of lies

- We describe consonants by talking about place, manner, and voicing

- The English writing system is a festival of falsehoods
			  
- We describe vowels by talking about height, front-back, and rounding

- The English writing system is a dumpster of deception

- Transcription, rather than writing systems, can help!

---

### Soon...

- We'll talk a bit more about how we describe 'what sounds make up a word'

- We'll talk about "segments"

- We'll talk about Prosody
