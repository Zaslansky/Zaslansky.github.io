All my slides are presented using [reveal.js](http://revealjs.com), and do not exist as Powerpoint or PDF, but instead, as websites.

To navigate my slides, use the arrow keys, the onscreen controls, or swipe on mobile.  To scan through slides, hit 'Escape'.

To print or make a PDF, add ?print-pdf to the URL after .html in Google Chrome and then 'Print' as usual.

(Please note that PDF/printing is not 'officially supported' by the instructor, and the results may be very strange in places)

### Handout Mode

- You can also turn slides into a handout by adding "_handout" before .html

- This may cause formatting errors, as this is automatically generated.  Apologies!

# How will we be learning this quarter?

---

## Three main methods of learning

- Class Sessions

- Textbook Readings

- Activities

---

### Class sessions

- Lecture style, but with room for questions

- Raise your hands with questions

- Podcasting

- I'll be repeating questions, for the Podcast

---

### Textbook Readings

- This is a good book

- It's also used in many hearing science programs!

- You'll get a great deal from actually doing the readings!

    - ... and your Discussions and Exams may include material from the readings alone

---

### Activities

- I'm a big fan of experiential learning

- The Discussions are designed to let you learn about hearing science in the real world

- The Exams are designed to let you apply your knowledge and gauge your understanding of the material

---

# How will we be evaluating learning?

---

## How will we evaluate your learning?

- Discussions

- Exams

---

### Discussions

- Allow you to discuss class topics in a low pressure way

- [Graded mostly on participation](http://savethevowels.org/discussion)

- Interactive, and experiential

---

### Exams

- Your two exams will gauge how much of the material you're actually absorbing

- Short answer and multi-choice

- Midterm in-class, Final during the final exam slot

- Please take advantage of the [Course Study Guide](https://savethevowels.org/docs/l113_studyguide.html) as you prepare for the exams.

    - This is a good way to check your own learning as you go

---

### Compassion is built into the grading

- You get one dropped discussion post free

- 60% of your grade is (effectively) completion graded self-guided learning

- Attendance is optional, at your own peril

- Contact us if life is going off the rails

---

### Be careful!

- I'm giving you a lot of leeway here, with relatively few assignments

	- I'm treating you like adults, and trusting you to do the work

- Studying is an ongoing process, so *learn actively*, so you know how the tests will go

- With great freedom comes great responsibility

- If you don't put in the effort, I will not be able to save you

---

# Questions so far?

---

# Building Our Culture of Integrity

---

### I have three starter rules about integrity this quarter

- Your discussions should be completed by you, in your own words and show your own knowledge

- All sources external to the class should be cited in a way that we can find the reference

- Please [show integrity asking for exceptions and grade changes](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/gradechanges/)

---

### What does completing assignments with integrity look like?

- What are signs of good scholarship? 

- What can you do to be fair to yourself and your classmates?

- How can you fairly earn your grades?

- How do you do sourcing and citation correctly?

---

### What does a lack of integrity look like?

- What's *unfair* to your classmates?

- What makes your degree worth less?

- What do you see as 'scummy' behavior?

- Where does group studying and discussion become problematic?

- Why is using ChatGPT and similar for discussions dumb?

---

### Why do you want your classmates to work with integrity?

- What does it mean to you?

- Is Academic Integrity just a conspiracy from big testing?

---

### How can you succeed in a very self-directed course?

- What are good ways to keep yourselves on track?

- How can you check your learning before you wreck yourself?

---
 
### Who are we?

- Linguists?

- Potential audiologists?

- Potential SLPs?

- Other random folks?

---

### What's our background?

- Self, friend or loved one with a hearing disorder?

- Ongoing hearing treatment?

- Experience in the field?

---

### What do you want to get out of this class?

---

# Why this class is personal for me

---

### This quarter...

- We'll talk about the ears

- Sound

- How we're able to hear

- ... and what it's like when it goes right, and wrong!

---

## For Next Time

- We'll start talking about sound, hearing, and what we're going to cover!
