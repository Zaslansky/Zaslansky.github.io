# Pitch, Loudness, and Localization

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- Perception of Frequency

	- Mel and Bark Scaling

- Perception of Loudness

	- Equal Loudness Contours

- Perception of Location

	- Vertical and Horizontal Localization

---

## Perception of Frequency

---

### Our perception of frequency is non-linear

- We now know a bunch of reasons!<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/basilar_tonotopic.jpg">

---

### Differences in critical frequency bands

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/masking_filterbandwidth.jpg">

---

### Evolutionary Differences!

- We care primarily about ~80-4000Hz!

---

### ... but Hertz doesn't capture this at all

- Hertz captures cycles per second

- ... but not our perception of frequency!

---

### Our perception of frequency is weird!

- We've already talked about auditory masking

    - Two sounds within the same 'critical band' seem like one sound

- We also percieve jumps in frequency non-linearly

---

### Do we hear frequency in a linear and reliable way?

Is the jump in file A the same as in file B?

A. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_600.wav"></audio>

B. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_10400_10600.wav"></audio>

- **Both of these are a 200Hz Jump!**

---

Is the jump in file A the same as in file B?

A. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_500.wav"></audio>

B. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_6400_6500.wav"></audio>

- **Both of these are a 100Hz Jump**

---

### So, our perception of frequency isn't Hertz-like

- **We want a perceptual scale for hearing!**

---

### Perceptual scales

- Mel scaling

- Bark scaling

---

### Mel Scale

- Maps numerical pitch measures to human perceptions of changes in pitch

- People will tell you that a sound's pitch is 'half as high' at x/2 mels relative to x mels

- Mel is the dominant perceptual frequency scale in use

    - It underlies [Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients](http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/) which are the dominant processing method in computational linguistics 

---

### Mel Scale

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/mel_scale.jpg">

---

### Mel Formula

- Mel(f) = 1125 \* ln(1+f/700)

    - f = Frequency in Hertz
    - This is a natural log
    - There are multiple formulae!

---

### Bark Scale

- The same basic idea, but using the critical bands themselves!

- Each 'band' in bark is centered around the psychoacoustic critical bands

---

### Bark Scale

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bark_bands.jpg">

---

### Bark Formula

-  Bark(f)=13\*arctan(0.00076\*f)+3.5\*arctan((f/(7500))\*(f/(7500)))

    - f = Frequency in Hertz
    - Again, there are other formulae!

---

### Bark vs. Mel vs. Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bark_mel_erb.jpg">

---

### Which should you use?

- Doesn't really matter!

- Linguists tend to use Bark

    - But you'll see Mel too!

- **The important part is knowing that we don't hear Hertz linearly!**

    - You know what else is non-linear?

---

## Amplitude Perception

---

### The auditory system is tuned to amplify some frequencies!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### We've already talked about wanting different units for amplitude

- Perceived amplitude is not linear with pressure

    - Hence using dB, rather than Pascal!

---

### ... and let's not forget the relationship between frequency and amplitude

- We don't hear equivalent loudness for equivalent amplitudes at different frequencies

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/equal_loudness_contours.jpg">

---

### This is the basis of dB HL

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/amplitude_vsfrequency.jpg">

---

### dB HL sets the minimum perceptible amplitude as zero!

- Regardless of frequency!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_blank.jpg">

---

### So, our perception of the basics of sound is... not awesome

- Duration

    - We won't talk about that, but it's cool

- Amplitude

    - Heavily convolved with frequency, and logarithmic!

- Frequency (Period, Wavelength)

    - Oof.

- Phase

    - That's a nope.

---

### ... but that's OK!

- Our perception is shaped by our evolution!

- The most important ranges for speech and survival are amplified

- None of our perceptions of *anything* are accurate

---

### We have nothing but our flawed perceptions to build a model of the world from

- Everything you've ever known is just a matrix of perceptual data

- You can't prove anything you've ever experienced happened, just that you perceived that it did.

- We're just isolated mindstates groping through an invisible world using our strange detectors

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/dudewaitwhat.jpg">

---

### Wait, where did that come from?

- Which brings us to...

---

## Sound localization?

---

### We want to know where sound came from

- "Did that lion just roar from behind me or in front of me?"

- "Where is that bird tweeting from?"

- "Where did that spring just go?"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_angle.jpg">

---

### We need two kinds of localization

- All positions can be calculated based on vertical and horizontal knowledge

- So, we just need to figure out two dimensions!

---

### Many animals can change the position of their ears

- [Turns out that we still try, even though it doesn't work anymore](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1462507/full)

- ... but we can't, so we need to figure out how to do...

---

## Horizontal Localization

---

### We use two sources of data for horizontal localization

- Both rely on *binaural* information

- Differences in *timing* between ears

- Differences in *loudness* between ears

---

### Time-of-arrival differences

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_horizontal_arrival.jpg">

---

### Interaural Time Differences

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_itd.jpg">

---

### Interaural Amplitude differences

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_horizontal.jpg">


---

### Think about a post in the water...

---

### Interaural Level Differences

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_ild.jpg">

---

### Both play a role

- Interaural time differences are used mostly in low frequencies

- Interaural amplitude differences are usable only in high frequencies

- The trade-off happens around 1 kHz

---

### This is acquired

- Each time my hearing changed, I re-learned where sounds are!

- Primarily at higher frequencies

    - Take a second to ponder why...

---

### Binaural effects can only give you horizontal cues

- Provided that your head is vertical

- How do we get vertical information?

---

## Vertical Localization

---

### For vertical information, we use the pinna

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_pinna.jpg">

---

### Different resonances imply different angles of incidence

- These are pinna-specific

    - You cannot localize sounds recorded with a fake pinna

- They also involve the resonances of the neck and shoulders

- Pinna cues are most important over 6,000 Hz

- [Here's a great paper on vertical localization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24076423)

---

### Localization is hard!

- We're best at it directly in front of us

- We're pretty bad at it behind us, and directly to our sides

---

### The cone of confusion

- These have exactly the same ITD

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/localization_coneofconfusion.jpg">

---

### There's other information too!

- We can move our heads

- We can use information from the room

- We can use frequency decay over time to judge distance

- We can use the doppler effect to identify fast movement

- We can identify the source visually

---

### Aside: Localization is hard to preserve

- [We're worse at localizing sound when wearing hearing protection](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264060)

    - ... especially when the pinnae are covered

- Modeling this is very, very complex

- Surround Sound systems cheat by *actually* playing sounds from different places

---

### There's a lot of research in Localization

---

### Wrapping Up


- Our perceptions of frequency are deeply non-linear

- Our perceptions of amplitude are deeply non-linear

- Localization is a hard task

- Horizontal Localization uses differences in timing and loudness between ears

- Vertical localization relies on pinna cues

- This is super complicated

	- ... and an area of major research!
