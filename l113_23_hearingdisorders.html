# Hearing Disorders

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### By understanding how things go *right*, we understand how they go wrong

- So we've already covered a number of hearing disorders

	- There's a bit more to mop up, though!

- Today, we're going to focus on causes of hearing loss, deafness, and weirdness in hearing!

---

### Today's Plan

- Causes of acquired hearing loss

- Presbycusis

- Causes of congenital hearing loss

- Tinnitus

---

## Causes of acquired hearing loss

---

### 'Acquired' hearing loss means the person could hear at some point

- As opposed to congenital (also 'pre-lingual') deafness, which is from birth

---

### Trauma

- Barotrauma

	- Can cause rupture or fistula of the TM, round window, or cochlear membranes

- Skull fractures

	- You can imagine how that might mess things up

- Middle ear damage

	- Insertion trauma

---

### Noise Related Hearing Loss

- This is the big one

- We've talked about it a bunch

- **Protect your ears!**

---

### Disorders of the Outer Ear

- Cerumen Impaction

	- Wax blockage causes hearing loss

- Foreign Objects

	- Plz do not insert objects into your ear

- Otitis Externa

	- Infection of the ear canal leading to swelling and pain

---

### Disorders of the Middle Ear

- Otitis Media

	- Infection of fluid in the middle ear

- Ossicular Dislocation

	- The Ossicles aren't properly attached

- Eustachian tube dysfunction

	- When pressure cannot equalize and fluid cannot drain

---

### Cholesteatoma

- A non-cancerous growth in the middle ear

- Usually associated with repeated OM

- Grows, eventually involving the ossicles, TM, and more

- Diagnosable from otoscopy or MRI

- Removed surgically

---

### Ménière's disease

- Overpressure of endolymph affecting hearing and balance

- Causes are unclear

- Often has strong vestibular *and* hearing effects

---

### Ototoxicity

- Medications or chemicals which affect (generally) the organ of corti

    - Mechanism can be cell death, blocking the endocochlear potential, and more!

- Quinine compounds, loop diuretics, aminoglycoside antibiotics (for some), and many more

- Opioid painkiller (ab)use can causing hearing loss

    - Rush Limbaugh's hearing loss is widely attributed to painkiller abuse

- Alcohol is vestibulotoxic, in the short term

    - Hence drunk people not being able to balance

---

### Disease Related Hearing Loss

- Many diseases can affect hearing

- Chicken Pox, Cytomegalovirus, Mumps, Meningitis, and lots more

- These have various effects on the organ of corti

- **The exact mechanisms here are often frustratingly vague!**

---

### Autoimmune Diseases and Hearing loss

- When your body attacks the structures needed for hearing, you lose hearing

- <img class="r-stretch" src="img/surprisedpikachu.jpg">

---

### Acoustic Neuroma and Otosclerosis

- More on this in 'Surgical Interventions'!

---

### ... but the hearing disorder most people are familiar with is...

---

## Presbycusis

---

### Presbycusis

- Also known as 'age-related hearing loss'

- Also known as

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/presbycusis_audiogram.jpg">

---

### Physiopathology of Presbycusis

- We're not 100% sure of the exact pathology

- There appears to be a genetic component which influences the degree of it

- Different people have different characteristics of loss

- These fit into different 'types'

---

### Some potential causes of presbycusis

- **Mechanical:** Stiffening of the basilar membrane

- **Neural:** Degeneration of the auditory nerves and spiral ganglion

- **Metabolic:** Loss of bloodflow and atrophy of the stria vascularis

- **Sensory:** Degradation of OHCs

- These can be mixed together, and people can be unique

---

### One nice way to put it

> Presbycusis is likely caused by the accumulation of various auditory insults over years.

- <small> Roehm C.E., Marino J., Parham K. (2013) Presbycusis. In: Kountakis S.E. (eds) Encyclopedia of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-23499-6_551 </small>
---

### Presbycusis is the check at the end of the meal

- "No, I can go shooting without hearing protection, it's fine the next morning"

- "Going to that concert without protection was fine, I didn't even notice anything!"

- "Oh, luckily that medication didn't affect me"

- "Smoking doesn't cause hearing loss, I hear things just fine"

- **Your cochlea remembers!**

---

---

### Even if you're not losing hearing now, take care!

- Because sooner or later, you'll be paying the bill

---

### There is no treatment for presbycusis

- Particularly given that there's no one cause

- Patients are generally 'treated' with amplification or CIs

- ... but that's all we can do

---

### OK, so that's how people lose hearing

- What about people who never started with it?

---

## Causes of 'Pre-Lingual' or Congenital Deafness

---

### Hereditary Genetic Conditions

- Around 50% of deafness in children is genetic in nature

- GJB2-related Congenital Deafness is the most common

	- The Connexin 26 (CX26) protein is rendered non-functional, and it helps with K+ transport

- These are recessive mutations

	- People can carry the mutation without being Deaf

	- This is why many hearing people have Deaf children

- [Here's a pamphlet on genetics of hearing loss](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/freematerials/parentsguide508.pdf)

---

### Genetic 'Syndromes'

- Here, deafness occurs alongside other developmental abnormalities

- Down Syndrome, Usher Syndrome, Treacher Collins Syndrome, and many more

- The source of the hearing loss varies

	- Down Syndrome is usually conductive loss

	- Usher syndrome is hair cell related and often causes balance issues too

	- Treacher Collins is due to...

---

### Atresia, Microtia and Anotia

- The pinna or ear canal are small, ill-formed or missing

- Many different extents, with different effects

- Always a *conductive* loss

---

### In-Utero Disease Exposure

- Rubella, Influenza, Mumps are the big ones

- Also Cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and herpes

- The mother may be relatively unaffected, but deafness may still occur

---

### An aside: The MMR Vaccine is 'Measles, Mumps, and Rubella'

- Measles and Mumps causes hearing loss in children and adults

- Rubella causes deafness in utero

- The MMRV vaccine also covers Chicken Pox

	- Which is also linked to hearing loss

- [There is no link between vaccines and autism, and the study this myth is based on was falsified](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked)

- If you care about hearing, **vaccinate your kids**

---

### In-Utero Ototoxicity

- The same compounds which can cause deafness in adults can cause congenital hearing loss

- Methylmercury is more dangerous during development than to adult hearing!

- *"Exposure to methylmercury most commonly occurs when people eat kinds of fish and shellfish that have high levels of methylmercury in their tissues"*

---

### There are more possible causes

- Hearing is very complex, and subtle changes during development can have non-subtle effects

- ... but those are some of the most common causes

---

### ... so that's why hearing goes away

- But do people ever hear MORE than they want to?

---

## Tinnitus

---

### Tinnitus is the sensation of sound which is not present

- "ringing", "buzzing", "static", "hissing", "roaring", "grasshoppers"

- Can be a single 'pitch' or broadband, at any pitch

- Can be 'quiet' or 'loud'

- Can be in one ear or both

---

### Tinnitus is a phenomenon, not a disease

- It's caused by many different things

- Generally associated with hearing loss and noise exposure

	- ... but not always

---

### Tinnitus is NOT the same as auditory hallucination

- [Auditory hallucination is a common symptom of psychiatric disorders](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/auditory-hallucinations-psychiatric-illness)

- Tinnitus perceptions are very basic ('ringing' or 'hissing' or 'noise')

- Auditory hallucinations are the perception of complex sounds which aren't real

	- e.g. voices, footsteps, music, animal sounds

- Tinnitus is usually not interpretable or confusable with sounds originating in the real world

	- People 'know their tinnitus'

	- Except maybe in audiograms!

---

### Tinnitus can be temporary or permanent

- "Ringing in your ears" after head, acoustic, or pressure trauma

	- 'My ears are still ringing from that concert'

- Some mildly ototoxic drugs cause tinnitus for the duration of use

---

### Tinnitus can be subjective or objective

- **Objective** tinnitus is *actual noise* inside your head

	- Pulsatile bloodflow, whooshing from heart murmurs, etc

	- Somebody else can hear the noise with a stethoscope

- **Subjective** tinnitus is the *sensation of noise which is not objectively present*

	- This is the far more common version!

---

### There are other interesting causes of sound perception

- [Here's a nice video on 'The Hum'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy_ctHNLan8) which discusses possible sources for it.

---

### We don't understand how it works, exactly!

- We suspect it's more of a 'brain' thing than an 'ear' thing

- There's not a scientific consensus on the causes

---

### Possible sources of tinnitus

- The brain trying to 'turn up sensitivity' due to missing or damaged hair cells

- Phantom hearing, along the lines of 'phantom pain' from a healed injury

- Neural connection imbalances or failures

- ... and many more!

---

### Long term effects of tinnitus

- There is no 'damage' or 'harm' caused by tinnitus

- Hearing is not further 'reduced' by it, and it has no balance effects

- Many people live with it without troubles

- **It's annoying as heck**

---

### Reducing the emotional and quality-of-life impact of tinnitus

- Counseling and Therapy (Cognitive behavioral therapy) to reduce the psychoemotional impact

- Masking the tinnitus (using music, background noise, or sound generators)

	- Wearable masking devices are a thing

- [Acoustic Neural stimulus approaches](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4134889/)

	- Feeding in a signal designed to compensate for the specific patient's hearing loss profile

	- The literature is unclear about effectiveness here

---

### So, tinnitus is super common

- ... but not super understood

- and not really 'treatable' at this time!

---

### Wrapping up

- There are many causes of adult hearing loss

- Age-related hearing loss is common, and steps you take today can reduce it

- Congenital deafness is often genetic, but can have other causes

- ... and tinnitus is as annoying as it is poorly understood
