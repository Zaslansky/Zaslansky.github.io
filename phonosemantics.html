## Sound and Meaning
Will Styler - Semantics

---

# The Classical View

---

### Non-arbitrary signs

*The sign is causally linked to the signfied*

Smoke indicates fire   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Bleeding indicates injury  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Will's presence indicates crappy puns   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Iconic (or representational) signs

*A referential abstraction from the signified*

# ☂ ☃ ☀   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Some hand gestures   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<img class="big" src="img/emoji.png">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

---

<img class="big" src="img/curve.jpg">

---

### Arbitrary Signs

*Referential only by agreement and widespread knowledge*

Non-representational symbols (♄)     
<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

<img class="tiny" src="img/stop.jpg">


<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Non-iconic gestures   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* ... and, most importantly...

---

# Language!

---

### We're kind of committed to that idea

> "Language - A System of Arbitrary Signs"

  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

(from Finegan's [Language: Its Structure and Use](http://www.amazon.com/Language-Its-Structure-Edward-Finegan/dp/0495900419))   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### (Most) language is based on sound

# Phonosemantics

---
### Phonosemantics

*The study of and search for non-arbitary meanings in speech sounds*

---

### How can sound have non-arbitrary meaning?

Iconicity   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Analogy   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Emergent groupings  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Sounds really mean something  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Meaning by Iconicity

---

### "Sound Effects"

* "Boom!"

* "Pew pew pew!"

* "Vroom vroom!"

* Sound effects can be arbitrary, too!

	* (c.f. Rimshot, Sad Trombone)

---

## Onomatopoeia

---

### Onomatopoeia

*Words which, when spoken, sound kind of like the things they represent*

* (See also the idea of an [Ideophone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideophone))

---

### Onomatopoetic Words in English

Gurgle   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Woof   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Snip   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Whoosh   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Tweet   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

<img class="big" src="img/batmanpow.jpg"> 

---

### <danger>What's your favorite onomatopoetic word?</danger>

---

### Onomatopoeia differs across languages 
		
---
		
<img class="big" src="img/rooster.jpg">

---

### A rooster says...

cock-a-doodle-doo (English)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukko kiekuu (Finnish)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

chicchirichí (Italian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kuklooku (Urdu)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

kukuriku (Hungarian)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Sourced from [this awesome site](http://www.eleceng.adelaide.edu.au/personal/dabbott/animal.html)

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

(So, different languages can't even map sounds onto sounds uniformly)

---

Sometimes, the meaning comes from *how* you say it

---

## Suprasegmental Changes

*The changes you can make to a pronunciation without changing the sequence of phonemes used.*

---

### Types of Suprasegmental Changes

Pitch of the voice   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Duration of sounds/words   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Voicing type (Breathy, Creaky) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Articulatory Setting  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

**How could we use each of these to express iconic meaning?**   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

... but meaning doesn't have to come from iconicity at all!

---

# Meaning by Analogy

---

### Phonological Analogy

*Mental links between words which sound similar to each other in some way*

"Meaning by association/spreading activation"  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Most relevant to neologisms <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Sometimes morphologically analyzable <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Meaning-by-analogy is *everywhere*

Slytherin House   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Severus Snape   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Luna Lovegood   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Voldemort   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Surmontil  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Zoloft   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Paxil <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Wellbutrin <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Analogy in Cosmetics

* Re-Nutriv

* Eternicils

* Amplicils

* Orchidee imperiale

	* lol

### Analogy in other products

Volkswagen Jetta   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Febreze   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Rogaine   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## ... but sometimes, whole groups of words sound alike

---

# Meaning by Emergent Groupings (Phonaesthemes)

---

## An Experiment

---

### "Would you like to buy a new Glimp?  It..."

a) Sharpens knives.

b) Lights up your house.

c) Tastes good.

---

### "Damnit, I left my meb in the car!"

a) I won't be able to sew as well.

b) I'll be unable to fill my bird feeders

c) What if there's a fire?!

---

### "Have you seen my snofter?..."

a) My nose is sore.

b) I dropped a glass.

c) It's cold in here.

---

### "I got diabetes.  It must be from drinking all that..."

a) Blurge cola

b) Murple cola

c) Slize cola

---

### "You Mom is plafty."

a) "Them's fighting words."

b) "Maybe?"

c) "Thanks!"


---

### "Your Mom is slafty."

a) "Them's fighting words."

b) "Maybe?"

c) "Thanks!"

---

### Phonaesthemes

*"Frequently recurring sound-meaning pairings that are not clearly contrastive morphemes"*

(definition from [Bergen 2004](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/language/v080/80.2bergen.pdf))  

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Phonaesthemes in English

gl- ‘light, vision’ *glimmer, glisten, glitter, gleam, glow, glint*, etc.   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

sn- ‘nose, mouth’ *snore, snack, snout, snarl, snort, sniff, sneeze*, etc.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

sl - 'pejorative', *slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth*, etc.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

b_l - 'expand abnormally', *blimp, bulge, bulk, balloon, blip*   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Phonaesthemes aren't morphemes!

in- *'inedible', 'inconceivable', 'indelible', 'incorrect'* is a morpheme, not a phonaestheme!

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## If they're not morphemes, what are they?

---

### Emergence

*Complex systems and patterns which arise through simple interactions*

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Langton's Ant

At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

<img height=800 src="img/langtonsant.gif">

---

### Emergence is useful in language

---

### It could account for phonological phenomena

* Bug -> Bugs

* Tug -> Tugs

* Rug -> Rugs

* Wug -> ???

	* Note that there's no "rule" here

---

### It could account for constructions in Syntax

* She cut her way through the jungle

* She fought her way through the orcs

* She bribed her way through the Senate

* She resected her way through the abdominal cavity.

	* Construction Grammar is an emergent flavor of syntax.

---

### It could account for phonaesthemes! 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### How could phonaesthemes emerge?

![](img/bergentable.png)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## How real are phonaesthemes?

---

### Bergen 2004

[Bergen 2004](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/language/v080/80.2bergen.pdf) tested this by playing pairs of words which were: 

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Phonaesthemes (glitter:glow)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Similar sounding (druid:drip)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Similar meaning (cord:rope)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Similar sound/meaning, but not a group (crony:crook)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Baseline (frill:barn)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### How real are phonaesthemes?

Reaction times were faster after a phonaestheme than after any other condition!   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

> These results very clearly indicate that targets are responded to much more quickly when they share a phonaestheme with their prime than when they share form, meaning, both, or nothing with it.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

So, they sure act real...   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Phonaesthemes in language

They can attract new members (drag, flag, lag, and *sacke* -> "sag")   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

[According to Keith McCune](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_internal_structure_of_Indonesian_roo.html?id=8kwHAQAAIAAJ), most Indonesian language words have phonosemantic components.     

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Japanese has a rich system of phonosemantics (according to [this guy](http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/infolib/meta_pub/G0000003gakui_D1004724)) 

  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### ... but all of these deal with relations between words.

## Do sounds themselves actually have meanings?   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

# The Meaning of Sounds

---

## There are two sides to this coin:

Psuedoscience "sound meanings"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Actual cognitive phenomena    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### "Sound symbolism" in product naming

"BlackBerry" (Fast segments, nicely timed)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Dasani" (CVCVCV, simple syllables)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Swiffer" (Psuedo-phonestheme, onomatopoetic)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

People pay [Lexicon Branding](http://www.lexiconbranding.com) lots of money to do this.

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

LOL   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---


### There are some real phenomena...

---

## An experiment!

---

![](img/boubakiki.png)

<h1 style="float: left;padding-left: 170px">Kiki</h1> 

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
<h1 style="float: right;padding-right: 150px">Bouba</h1>

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### The Bouba/Kiki Effect

First observed on Tenerife (in Spanish) by Wolfgang Köhler in 1929.  There, it was "Takete" vs. "Baluba".

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Repeated with US and Tamil Undergrads by V.S. Ramachandran and Edward Hubbard. [95% labeled them as expected](http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf).    

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

[2.5 year old kids show a Bouba/Kiki effect too!](http://psych.mcmaster.ca/maurerlab/Publications/Maurer_bouba.pdf)   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Why Kiki and Bouba?

Perhaps it's mouth-shape related (high vowels vs. lower vowels?  Lip rounding?)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Perhaps direct sensory integration.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

[Autistic Children do not show a Bouba/Kiki effect](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470910701563681)  

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

But it's clearly more complicated than the marketers think.    <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

# Problems with Phonosemantics

---

![](img/paperbag.jpg)

---

### Phonosemantic Problem #1

* Neologisms (new words) aren't uniform.

---

<img width=800 src="img/doglanguages.jpg">

---

### Phonosemantic Problem #2


* Different languages use different sounds to describe the same meaning.

---

## If these effects exist, they're not that strong.

---

# So, do sounds have meaning?

---

### Words and speech can have iconic meaning

Onomatopoeia   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Iconic Suprasegmentals   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Words can pick up meaning from near neighbors

Similar sounding words can prime meanings  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Spreading activation of meaning   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Groups of words can sound alike

Phonaesthemes are groups of semantically and phonologically related words.    <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Phonaesthemes emerge from lexical statistics   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Words with phonaesthemes will inherit the meaning of the group.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Sounds can have meaning

![](img/boubakiki.png)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### ... but not nearly as often as the marketers wish!

One concept, many words  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

It's most certainly not deterministic   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

These effects are the exception, not the rule.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### So, sounds have meaning, but...
