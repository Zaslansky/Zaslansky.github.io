Let's back up for a second.

---
### "Jony chased Dieter"

<img class="big" src="img/fish_jonydieter.jpg"> 

---

## "How do we know who did what to whom?"

---

### Grammatical Relations

How a language marks who did what to whom

---

### English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.

* "Jony chased Dieter"

* "Kevin waved to Niloo"

* "Niloo waved to Kevin"

* "Will ate his tofu wistfully"

---

### ... but that's not the only way!

---

### Some languages affix morphemes onto words to mark grammatical relations

* We call these morphemes "case markers"

* Nominative Case - "The Subject"

* Accusative Case - "The Object"

---

### Grammatical Case

Tacking morphemes onto words to indicate their role in the sentence

- Grammatical case is found in 60% of languages in [WALS](https://wals.info)

---

### Russian Case Marking

- sobaka vidye-la koshk-u
- dog.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST cat-ACC.FEM
- "The dog saw the cat."

- koshka vidye-la sobak-u 
- cat.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST dog-ACC.FEM
- "The cat saw the dog."

---

### Russian Case Marking

- Ya tyebya vizh-u
- I.NOM you.ACC see-1SG
- "I see you"

- Ti myenya vid-yesh
- you.NOM I.ACC see-2SG
- "You see me"

So, Nominative and Accusative cases are really useful!

---

### ... but Russian has more cases!

---

## The Russian Case System

---

## The Russian Case System

* Nominative Case - "The Subject"

* Accusative Case - "The Direct Object"

* Dative Case - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* Genitive Case - "The Possessor (and more)"

* Locative Case - "The Location (and more)"

* Instrumental Case - "The Tool (and more)"

---

### Dative Case

Marks the indirect object, or recipient of an item

---

### Dative Case

* Kevin dayot tsvet-i Lis-ye
* Kevin-NOM give.3sg Flowers-ACC.PLUR Lisa-DAT
* "Kevin gave Lisa flowers"

* Enchilad-i mne da-la Niloo 
* Enchilada-ACC.PLUR 1sg.DAT give-PAST.FEM Niloo-NOM
* "Niloo gave me Enchiladas"

---

### Dative as "Goal"

* Ya pomoga-yu Kevinu
* 1sg.NOM help-present.1sg Kevin-DAT
* "I'm helping Kevin"

* Mne zvoni-l Barack Obama
* 1sg-DAT call-past.masc Barack Obama-NOM
* "Barack Obama called me"

C) Jony - NOM, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - DAT

D) Jony - DAT, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - NOM

---

---

* Ya vi-zhu sharik Pong-a
* 1sg.NOM see-1sg ball-ACC Pongo-GEN
* "I see Pongo's ball"

* Michael Bay sam-aya bolsh-aya problem-a Amerik-ii
* Michael Bay single-NOM large-NOM problem-NOM America-GEN

A) Will - ACC, Dragon - NOM, iPad - GEN

B) Will - NOM, Dragon - GEN, iPad - ACC

C) Will - GEN, Dragon - ACC, iPad - NOM

D) Will - NOM, Dragon - ACC, iPad - GEN

---

### Locative Case

Marks the location of events

* (this is also called the "Prepositional Case")

---

### Locative Case in action

- Ya zhiv-u v Californi-i
- 1sg.NOM live-1sg in California-LOC
- "I live in California"

---

### Instrumental Case

Marks an object being used

---

### Instrumental Case in Action

* Andres pish-et karandash-om
* Andres-NOM write-3sg pencil-INST
* "Andres writes with a pencil"

* Ya yem borscht so smetanoy
* 1sg-NOM eat borscht-ACC with sour.cream-INST
* "I eat borscht with sour cream"

---

### Russian used to have a Vocative case!

- Calling out to somebody

- Would differentiate 'Will' from 'will'

- [Perhaps it's coming back](https://www.languagesoftheworld.info/morphology/case/vocative-case-russian.html)

---

## The Russian Case System

* Nominative Case - "The Subject"

* Accusative Case - "The Direct Object"

* Dative Case - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* Genitive Case - "The Possessor (and more)"

* Locative Case - "The Location (and more)"

* Instrumental Case - "The Tool (and more)"

- *It's actually **way** more complicated than this!*

---

### So, now you know the Russian system

- Just in case.

---

## Other Case Systems

---

### Languages have different case systems

- Common cases to mark the subject of an intransitive or agent of transitive sentence (Nominative), the direct object (Accusative), the indirect object (Dative).

    - ... but it doesn't always work that way!

- There are lots of other cases out there

- Often, they code things that prepositions are used for in other languages

- But we're not Finnished yet

---

### Finnish Cases

- NOM, ACC, GEN
- Partitive: Marks a part, not the whole
- Inessive: Marks being inside the noun
- Elative: Marks coming out from the noun
- Illative: Marks going into the noun
- Adessive: Marks being near or close to the noun
- Ablative: Marks moving from off of the noun
- Allative: Marks moving onto the noun

---

### Finnish Cases (Continued)

- Essive: Marks a temporary state of being ("as a grad student" or "on Thursday")
- Translative: Marks a change of state
- Instructive: Roughly instrumental, but more generic manner
- Abessive: Marks something that's lacked.
- Comitative: Marks being with something

---

### Cases mean different things in every language!

- Just because the grammar says 'Dative', it doesn't mean it's the same as Russian or German

- You'll need to learn these details for every language you encounter

- You never know what kind of cases you'll deal with

- *Don't make a deadly assumption!*

---

### Wrapping Up

- Case is a very important grammatical feature

- Don't assume it works the same in all languages

- It's magical

---

## For Next Time

- Some more data, then we'll start verbal inflection!

- HW1 is online
