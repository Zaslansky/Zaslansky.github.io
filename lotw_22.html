# Agreement!

---

### "What's the difference between case and agreement?"

---

## Case marks roles on arguments!

---

### Russian Case Marking

* Will videt kochku
* Will-NOM see-3sg CAT-ACC
* "Will saw the cat"

---

### With case, you make the arguments wear nametags

* So you know what role the arguments are playing

---
### Will-NOM see-3sg CAT-ACC

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/myroleisagent.jpg"> 

---

### Will-NOM see-3sg CAT-ACC

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/myroleisobject.jpg"> 

---

## Agreement marks identity on verbs!

* "Rather than marking the arguments, let's just make sure the verb points to who did it!"

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/chucknorriswashere.jpg"> 

---

### Spanish Agreement Marking

* Yo veo el gato
* 1sg see.1sgsubj el cat
* I see the cat

* The arguments aren't marked

* *... but the verb lets us know who did it!*

---

### Spanish Agreement Marking

* Michael Bay hizo peliculas malas
* Michael Bay make.3sgsubj.past movie-pl bad-pl
* "Michael Bay made bad movies"

* *We know that the plural argument did it!*

---

### Agreement can use many ways of showing identity

* Person marking (1sg, 2sg, etc)

	* 2sg did it!

* Number marking (singular, plural, etc)

	* The group with more than one item did it!

* Gender marking (masc, fem, neuter)

	* It was the masculine thing!


---

### More ways of showing identity!

* Noun class

	* It was the large, flat object!

* New vs. old information markers

	* The thing I mentioned first did it!
	
* <danger>Any others?</danger>

---

### Let's test your skills!

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 
squirrele eta acornu

squirrel.NOM eat acorn.ACC

"The Squirrel ate the Acorn"

A) "This is case"

B) "This is agreement"

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 
kula-knas Michael Bay Will 

judge-object.is.evil Michael Bay Will 

"Will judges Michael Bay"

A) "This is case"

B) "This is agreement"

---

## So, are we all in...

# Agreement!?

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">

---

## Three methods of marking grammatical relations!

* Word Order

* Case

* Agreement

---

### Some languages use more than one.

* Spanish uses word order and agreement

* Russian uses agreement and case

* English uses agreement, word order, and case.

	* "I go" vs. "She goes", word order, and "he/him"

---

(When more than one is used, it's usually because the first system isn't quite robust enough)

* <danger>Why can't Spanish use just agreement?</danger>

---

### Wrapping up

* Uto-Aztecan languages are awesome

	* We'll learn more Monday
	
* Mayan languages are awesome

	* Know their features
	
* Agreement and case are different

	* ... but both awesome

---

### ... and don't forget to order lots of ahuacamolli next time you go to Chilpoctli

---

## In Recitation: Something awesome.

---

## Next time: Tarahumara with Jesús Villalpando
