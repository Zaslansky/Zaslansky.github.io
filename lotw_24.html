### Want a fun linguistics class for Spring?

* LING 2040 ("Language and Gender") is being taught by Jessica Holman
	* Who is awesome, and loves this stuff

* This is high-quality sociolinguistics

* It fulfills an Arts and Science Diversity requirement

# Quechuan Languages

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/quechuan_map.png">

---

### Quechuan Languages

* Spoken mostly in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador

* Around 10 million speakers

* May be related to the nearby Aymara Languages
	
	* This is the controversial "Quechumara" language grouping

* This family is best thought of as a dialect continuum for Quechua
---

### Quechua

* An Official language in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador

* 8-10 million speakers

---

### Features of Quechua

* Three vowels (a, i, u)

* No voiced/voiceless contrast

* SOV, Agglutinating

* Inclusive/exclusive pronouns

---

### Quechua has 10 million speakers, but no commonly-used writing system

* <danger>What effects would this have on the language and the speakers?</danger>

* Lack of writing system often hurts a language's chances of survival

	* "Well, I'll just write in Spanish!"

* Written language is a great way to maintain culture!

---

## This is not unique

* Only 1/3 of world languages have a writing system

	* ... and even then, many speakers are not literate in their languages

* *Don't take "language" to mean "written language"*

# Tupian Languages

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/tupian_map.png">

Tupi-Guarani is in light pink

---


### Tupian Languages

* Spoken in Brazil and South America

* Around 70 languages total

* The most widely spoken is Guarani

---

### Guarani

* An official language of Paraguay (along with Spanish)

* Spoken both by Europeans and Indigenous folks

* Heavily influenced by missionaries and the Jesuits

	* More on that later...

* 4.8 Million speakers

---

### Features of Guarani

* Six vowels (+ nasal versions)

* Inclusive vs. Exclusive pronouns

* Prenasalized stops

	* Whoa!
	
* Circumfixion!

* Nasal Harmony!

---

(Finally, some new features!)

---

## Circumfixation

---

### We've talked about lots of affixation

* **Prefix** - Attaches to the beginning (as in **pre**fix)

* **Suffix** - Attaches to the end (as in loud**ly**)

* **Infix** - Attaches in the middle (Abso-**fucking**-lutely)

* **Circumfix** - Attaches to *both sides*

---

<lang>Guarani</lang><br><ldata>Tupian - Amazonas</ldata>

rekororõ

'You Snore'

* **ne**rekororõ**i**

* 'You don't snore'

---

<lang>Guarani</lang><br><ldata>Tupian - Amazonas</ldata>

ojupí

'They go up'

* **nd**ojupí**ri**

* 'They don't go up'

---

### Circumfixation is the only kind of affixation English won't touch

* ... but I encourage you to try

	* "Uh oh, it's produced by Fu-Michael-Bay-cking"

---

## Nasal Harmony

---

### Nasal Harmony

When nasality spreads throughout the word triggered by a nasal vowel

---

<lang>Guarani</lang><br><ldata>Tupian - Amazonas</ldata>

laseraʔɨ̃ʔɲãkãɣ̃ãpãĩtẽɾei

‘my child is just too stubborn at school’

* (Yes, that's a nasalized fricative.)

	* (Yes, that's *really* weird.)

---

Speaking of really weird...

---

### Guarana

* Guarani for 'The Eyes of the People'

### Linguistic Diversity in Amazonas

* Around 300 languages

* The jungle makes it rather easy to be isolated

* The Arawakan family is the largest family

	* Pereltsvaig talks about it some, but that's all we'll do

---

### We can't come anywhere near showing the diversity of this region

* So let's just hear some examples

---

<iframe data-autoplay width="840" height="500" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SHv3-U9VPAs?start=45"></iframe> 

---

### Pirahã is a really odd language

* Pereltsvaig talks about why

* So does "[Don't sleep, there are snakes!](http://www.amazon.com/Dont-Sleep-There-Are-Snakes/dp/0307386120)"

	* Which is pretty entertaining

---

### The least controversial crazy thing about Pirahã?

* Pirahã has only three numbers: Fewer, Few, and Many.

---

### How many Pirahã speakers does it take to screw in a lightbulb?

* Fewer!

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/facepalm_bear.png"> 

---

### Many of these languages are struggling and dying

* Business is conducted in a *Lingua Franca*
	* Many are already bilingual

* Some indigenous groups are merging as populations dwindle

* Many populations are now threatened by oil drilling, logging, and ranching

* So, we cannot assume that these languages will last, even if they're isolated

---

We have a paradox in Linguistics (and anthropology)

* ### Do we intervene and describe isolated languages and cultures, or stay back and let them be?

* <danger>What do you think?</danger>

* This brings up another controversial group!

---

### Missionaries in Linguistics

<img class="big" src="humorimg/missionaries.jpg">

---

### The role of Missionaries in Linguistics

* Historically, lots of linguistic research has been done under the guise of "missionary work"

* This does make some sense

---

### The Goals of Descriptive Linguists

* Learn the language

* Learn about the Culture

* Develop a writing system

* Write a grammar

---

### The Goals of Missionaries

* Learn the language

* Learn about the Culture

* Develop a writing system

* Write a grammar

* **Translate the Bible!**

	* Or whatever other important holy text they've got

---

### Missionaries write grammars 

* Missionaries were doing linguistic descriptions before they were a thing

* Many of our early grammars of indigenous languages are from missionaries

* Sometimes, the only outsiders to visit a language are missionaries

* Many missionaries are also quite linguistically compentent

* Dan Everett (the Pirahã guy) started as a missionary

---

### Missionaries sometimes write *bad* grammars

* There's a strong potential for bias

	* "No no, I don't need to know your terms for boating..."

	* "We're just going to call all of those other Gods "Satan"..."

* Missionaries are sometimes sent out without training

	* "Wayaki is an isolating, polysynthetic language with oral and nasal tones"
	
	* "This clearly displays a Nominative/Ergative case system"
	
* ... but they always collect data, which can be re-analyzed!

---

### Missionaries often create parallel texts

* Putting the same text (or story, book, etc) into two different languages

* The Jehovah's Witnesses are particularly prolific translators
	* [Here are their leaflets in Quechua](http://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/?contentLanguageFilter=qvw)
	* ***The above link does not constitute an endorsement of any teachings or faith***
	
* There are a shocking number of evangelical videos in odd languages on Youtube
	* [These folks are a prolific example](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo8b-uS6uD5l9YitDJpA2RA)
	* ***The above link does not constitute an endorsement of any teachings or faith***

* These are really useful in computational linguistics, and really interesting to the rest of us

---

### Missionaries can create good resources

* [SIL International](http://www.sil.org) is a Faith-based group

* They make IPA fonts for computers, language description resources

* ... and they run the Ethnologue

* *The SIL folks are top-shelf linguists*

---

... but there's one fundamental difference between Missionary work and Linguistic work

---

Linguists and Anthropologists ***describe*** languages and cultures

* Missionaries aim to ***change*** language and cultures

---

### Changing culture changes languages

* Guarani has a great deal of Spanish in it because of the Jesuits

* Religious conversions wipe out religious vocabulary

	* ... and that tends to be a rich linguistic area

* Cultural changes lead to language changes too
	
* Cultural changes tend to be assimilatory

	* Missionaries tend to encourage drift towards European values
	
* Linguists change cultures, too!

	* They just don't mean to.

---

### Everybody has an opinion on whether that's OK

* ... and I'm not going there

---

... but both linguistic description and missionary work play a role in the Circle of Linguistic life.

---

### Wrapping Up

* Quechua is awesome

* Guarani is awesome

	* ... and Guarana is creepy
	
* Amazonas is crazy-diverse

* Outsiders play a complex role in language preservation

---

## In Recitation: Nothing! Recitation is cancelled!

---

## Next time: The Circle of Linguistic Life!
