# The Physiology of the Outer and Middle Ear 

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- The Tympanic Membrane

- The Acoustic Reflex

- Conductive vs. Sensorineural Hearing Loss

- Middle Ear Implants

---

# The Physiology of the Tympanic Membrane

---

### Review: The Tympanic Membrane

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_membrane3.jpg">

---

### The Tympanic Membrane is complex

- Around 0.1mm thick and 10mm in Diameter

- Three layers

	- Outer Cutaneous Layer

	- Middle Fibrous Layer

	- Inner mucous membrane

---

### The tympanic membrane can be perforated!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_perf.jpg">

---

### This can happen in many ways

- Infection

	- Acute Otitis Media or Externa

- Physical Trauma

	- Q-Tips, Foreign objects, bad wax removal, head trauma

- Barotrauma

	- Explosions, Scuba diving, air travel, or sudden negative pressure

---

### The tear is usually in the Pars Tensa

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_membrane3.jpg">

---

### This is diagnosed by looking at the TM

- Or by measuring pressure changes when you artificially pull a vaccuum in the OE

- Or by looking at the amount of sound which is absorbed by the ear 

	- More on these later

---

### The tympanic membrane usually heals itself 

- It usually heals naturally

	- [They'll often heal within a month or so](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10388876)

- [Perhaps nature can be helped!](https://www.nature.com/articles/546S5a)

- It can also be fixed surgically

---

### Tympanoplasty

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_perf.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/temporalis_fascia.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_perf_postop.jpg">

---

### Sometimes you perforate the TM on purpose!

- Myringotomy is the cutting of the pars tensa to relieve pressure

- But sometimes you want it to last!

---

### Tympanostomy

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_tube.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_tube2.jpg">

---

### Tympanostomy tubes

- Simple, outpatient procedure

	- Children are usually anesthetized for this

	- Adults power through

- Not particularly painful

- They fall out on their own in 6-9 months

---

### Tympanostomy Downsides

- Insertion is non-fun

- You can't swim without earplugs 

- Liquids can get into the ME

- Your ears don't pop

	- But they don't need to!

---

### So, the TM is magical

- And really, really important!

- Be kind to your TM!

---

# The Acoustic Reflex

---

### Anatomy Review

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

### Anatomy Review

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_lateral.jpg">

---

### The Acoustic Reflex

- Also referred to as the 'Stapedius Reflex'

- **Causes** a temporary conductive hearing loss

	- 15-20dB Hearing loss

- [There's debate as to whether the Tensor Tympani is involved in humans](https://synapse.koreamed.org/DOIx.php?id=10.11637/kjpa.2015.28.2.63)

	- Some say it's only the Stapedius muscle!

---

### How does it work?

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_lateral.jpg">

---

### What triggers it?

- Sound >60 dB above the hearing threshold

	- Different sources have a range of 60-90 dB

- Speech also triggers it

	- Chewing too!

---

### You must have hearing to have an acoustic reflex!

- People with severe cochlear hearing loss have no acoustic reflex

- Severe conductive loss can reduce/prevent it

- Same thing with serious cochlear nerve damage

- This means that it's *triggered in the pons, not the ear!*

---

### How long does it take?

- 10ms to start, roughly

- 100ms+ to reach full tension

	- Compare to 300 **microseconds** blast from a gunshot

- Tension reduces within a few seconds

	- But there's some role in long term noise exposure

- [This is now in use in cars](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/safety/pink-noise-says-prepare-for-impact)

---

### Why do we care?

- It's awesome

- It's super diagnostic!

- [Check out this paper giving more detail!](https://open.umich.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/acoustic__stapedius__reflexes.pdf)

---

### Speaking of diagnosis

- We want to know where hearing loss is coming from

---

# Conductive vs. Sensorineural Hearing Loss

---

### Sound has a long path with many points of failure

- External **obstructions**

- Middle Ear Pathologies

- Cochlear Physiology issues

- **Different causes of HL get different names!**

---

### Conductive Hearing Loss

- Caused by problems between the world and the Oval Window

- External obstructions and infections

- Fluid, OM, Pressure issues

- Tumors in the ME

- TM perforations, ossicular dislocations

---

### Sensorineural ('Cochlear') Hearing Loss

- Caused by problems beyond the Oval Window

- Issues inside the Cochlea

- Issues with the hair cells

- Issues with other physiological enablers of hearing

- Issues with the auditory nerve

- Neural issues

---

### These are very different!

- Conductive loss is often more treatable medically

- Conductive loss can generally be restored to a greater extent

- With profound sensorineural loss, nothing else matters

	- Doesn't matter what the middle ear is doing if nobody's listening

- ... but a complete conductive loss is bad news!

	- The complicated parts are working, but the sound can't get there!

---

### Complete conductive loss is possible

- Missing ossicles

- Irreparable TM

- Missing or scarred-shut ear canals

---

### What can we do to help people with conductive loss?

- Hearing aids are one approach

	- "Make the incoming signal louder"

- ... but if we want to get fancy, we can use...

---

## Middle Ear Implants

---

### How can we replace the middle ear?

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

### Let's vibrate the cochlear fluid ourselves!

---

### Some devices vibrate the Ossicles or Round Window

- 'Soundbridge' 

- 'Otologics'

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middle_ear_implant2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middle_ear_implant4.jpg">

---

### Some devices vibrate the skull

- The 'Baha' device

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middle_ear_implant3.jpg">

---

### The Envoy Esteem

- "Let's use the TM as a microphone, and then vibrate the stapes"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middle_ear_implant5.jpg">

---

### Middle Ear Implants

- Offer some increased convenience relative to hearing aids

- Don't look like hearing aids

- Can work where there are no ossicles or TM or ear canal

- Offer another choice for **conductive** hearing loss

---

### Wrapping Up

- The Tympanic Membrane is awesome, and you want it intact

- The Acoustic reflex is awesome, but it won't save you

- Conductive and Sensorineural Hearing Loss are different

- Middle Ear Implants are *really cool*

---

### Next time

- We'll think more about the OHCs and the Cochlear Amplifier
