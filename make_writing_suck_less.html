# Making the Act of Writing Suck Less

### Will Styler - CSS Colloquium

<https://savethevowels.org/talks/make_writing_suck_less.html>

---

### Writing kind of sucks

- It's wonderful, enjoyable, and important to our species

- ... but the process, in modern times, sucks

---

### We are trapped in a world of unintuitive tools

- "Do I want Semi-bold or bold here?"

- "Wait, where'd that pagebreak go?"

- "No damnit, keep indenting the old list, don't make a new one"

- "Why are you trying to turn this entire paragraph into a link?"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/fuckupdocument.jpg">

---

### It wasn't always this way

- With pen and paper, you can do whatever you please

	- If you want bigger, write bigger

	- If you want smaller, write smaller

	- If you want a picture, draw one

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/voynich.jpg">

---

### We have been convinced by bad tools that this is how writing is done

- "What you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG)

	- "This window displays what the program thinks you wanted"

- You generate text and then tell the tool what a chunk of text should look like by poking buttons

	- Over, and over, and over, hoping you do it consistently

	- Until the tool decides to do something else

---

### What if there were another way?

- "What you want is what you get" (WYWIWYG)

	- "Here's what you asked for, if you'd like to make changes, I'll make it again"

	- "You tell me what the text is and what role it plays using **markup**, and how each role should look, and I'll make it happen"

	- "Give me a list of bibliography entries, and tell me where they're referenced, and I'll link them and format them"

	- "I could make this document into a Word Doc, a PDF, a website, a slideshow, whatever, just tell me what you want"

---

### We want to write, as smoothly as possible

- We want to think about *what we're writing*, not *how to make it so*

- We want our writing tools to get out of our way and let us write

- **Anything causing friction between your brain and the final draft should be eliminated**

---

### Microsoft Word

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/rasp.jpg">

---

## Statement of Bias

- I am a free-and-open-source software zealot with substantial trust issues

	- Controversial statements will be labeled with "ðŸ¤¡"

- I am also a Unix person, and tend to use that philosophy

- Your mileage may vary

---

### Today's Plan

- The Semantics of Formatting

- Word and why it sucks

- LaTeX and why it sucks

- Markdown and why it sucks

- Pandoc and why it's awesome

- My life's workflow

---

## The Semantics of Formatting

---

### Formatting should mean something

- Why is the text up there bigger?
	- Knowing that seems important


- Why is the 'knowing that' smaller and grayer?

- Why are references formatted as they are?

- What actual kinds of formatting do you need?

---

### For most people

- Text and Basic text variations (e.g. *italic*, **bold**)

- Lists and enumerations

- Sections, Subsections, Subsubsections

- Included images with captions

- Included citations, links, and footnotes

- Breaks and boundaries and boxes

- **Every element of the text should have a reason for being one of these things**

---

### Bad formatting is bad teaching

- "Wait, why is that a link?"

- "I don't have enough information to find this citation"

- "Why is this word bold?"

- "Hold on, did we switch sections already?"

- "This section isn't in the table of contents? What does that mean?"

---

### Formatting is important

- It should be consistent, meaningful, visible, and understandable

- ... and every single word should have a format that it should be

- **Doing formatting wrong hurts your argument**

---

## Microsoft Word Sucks

---

### Microsoft Word is great for somebody's grandmother

- "Oh, I put the blue around the text and then I press the black B and it gets blacker!"

- "Wow!  I can change the font to *squints* Comical Sans MS. How fun!"

- "Ooh, look at this, I can put a picture of a minion in the corner!"

- "I'm going to make this the best bridge club poster Edna and Rosemary have ever seen."

---

### It makes writing, then styling everything afterwards, easy

- "I don't know what my document should look like, here's a platform to write it, then adjust it until it looks like what I think it should look like"

- It is unquestionably powerful for exotic styling on a small amount of text

---

### You are not Edna

- You know what your document needs to look like, or are told

- Your documents are tens or hundreds of pages

- It *matters* where the pictures show up on the page

- You are not retired and do not have infinite time to press buttons

- Thus...

---

### Word absolutely, irredeemably sucks for academic writing

- So does GoogleDocs, LibreOffice, Scrivener, WordPerfect, and every other WYSIWYG editor

- You don't *need* the advantages that these tools offer

- You need it to shut up and make your documents

- Microsoft hates you, and has the goal to extract the exact largest amount of money they can from you before you rebel (ðŸ¤¡)

- Lots of academics turn to LaTeX

---

## LaTeX is better

---

### LaTeX is a form of the TeX programming language

- Developed by Donald Knuth

- You write the 'source code' for the finally rendered document

- You write, write, write, and then 'compile' your document to see the form

- Free, open-source, and community driven

- In practice, use XeLaTeX which supports Unicode (ðŸŽ‰)

---

### Documents are programmed

- "Take this code mixed with text, make it into a pretty document"

- The files you create are plaintext, and use no proprietary format

- You don't do anything besides generate content, and declare how that content should be formatted

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/latex_sample_code.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/latex_sample_gen.jpg">

---

### LaTeX does a lot of the work for you

- Section numbering does not need humans

- Compiling and formatting your bibliography based on citation codes is not a creative task

- Tables of Contents are deterministic from section labels

- Numbering Figures, Examples, and Diagrams is dumb

- Pulling in tables from files generated in R is easy

- Journals often provide TeX templates, so your document is *automatically* in the right format

---

### The boring parts are regenerated every time you run the command

- You never need to 're-number' anything, and will never 'miss a citation'

- All references can stay current, even when their referents change

- You don't need to manually move diagrams to fit the text, it happens for you

- You can just change the document, and it'll change all the rest

---

### LaTeX has incredible depth

- You can generate slides, [diagrams](https://savethevowels.org/talks/diagrams), and more in LaTeX

- You can create exams, letters, handouts, and hundreds of other things

- It speaks Math as a first language, and syntax trees, and numbered examples, and...

- It is all you actually need for document generation for the rest of your life

- LaTeX can do The Thing, if you're willing to put in The Time.

	- ... but that's partly why....

---

## LaTeX sucks

---

### Microsoft Word's Learning Curve

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/can_phone.jpg">

---

### LaTeX's learning Curve

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/cable_management.jpg">

---

### Installing LaTeX is not straightforward

- Not available for all platforms (e.g. iOS, Android)

- Big, bulky downloads

- Finicky installs

- It's often easier to use an online service (e.g. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/))

---

### Track Changes isn't a thing

- Except on Overleaf

- Or unless you have both versions of the .tex file and use file comparison tools

---

### "You don't use Word?!"

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/disgusted.jpg">

---

### LaTeX is harder to share

- Folder containing images, bibliography info, included files, etc rather than *one file*

- You can't edit the 'final product'

---

### LaTeX is *heavy*

- \textbf{}

- \subsubsection{}

- \includegraphics{/home/wstyler/Documents/awfulthings/microsoftword.jpg}

- ``` ``Quotes use two different kinds of punctuation to be done right'' ```

- LaTeX crashes when you include a % or # without an escape character `\#`
	- Do you really want to `\` every time you `&`Â `%`Â `$`Â `#`Â `_`Â `{`Â `}`Â `~`Â `^`Â `\`?

---

### LaTeX has *massive* power, but with *massive* overhead

- Anything is possible, but *everything* is a bit more difficult

- For writing a quick letter of recommendation, or website, or document, LaTeX is overkill

- What if there was a way to do *most* of your writing in a non-sucking method, and use LaTeX commands only when you need more power?

- Then put the output into whatever format you need?

---

## Markdown is amazing

---

### Markdown is a lightweight plaintext formatting language

- [Developed by John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) in the early 2000s 

- Contains a set of basic commands allowing you to do most text formatting things quickly

- Widely supported by Github, Discord, Google Docs, Gradescope, Jupyter, RStudio, Reddit, and many many more

- Allows you to write *plaintext* which can easily be formatted however you'd like

---

### Aside: Plaintext is the best format for storing data (ðŸ¤¡)

- Proprietary formats rot and die
	- Programs live and die
	- Licenses and subscriptions expire

- "Open" formats are great, but they rot too
	- You *will* have to open a file you created 20 years ago
	- If nobody's written code for that format in 10 years, can it really open?

- Plaintext will always survive
	- It is the tardigrade of file formats

- Make sure your data is (or can be) in a plaintext readable format
	- .txt, .md, .tex, CSV/TLD, XML, JSON, HTML

---

## Never put your data into software you can't take it out of

---

### Markdown uses symbols to format plaintext

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/markdown_code.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/markdown_output.jpg">

---

### Markdown is super easy

- It's an open standard, which is available in a number of places

- It is web-native, allowing linking and playing well with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- It handles the most common formatting operations

- It's readable as plaintext, but can be easily converted to other formats

- It works with any language which supports the symbol set

---

### Markdown is super fast

- You're basically writing words, but occasionally adding bits
	- You can write as fast as you can type and think

- As long as you have a full keyboard, and a keyboard-based editor, *you never have to move the mouse*

- Formatting adds 1-5 keystrokes to a word

- You never need to 'escape' a character

- Files are in the tens of *kilobytes*
	- All of my 2,500 markdown files fit in 17 MB

---

### I use Markdown for everything

- Documents?  Markdown

- Letters of recommendation?  Markdown

- [Websites](https://savethevowels.org/)? Markdown

- [This slideshow](https://revealjs.com/)? Markdown

- My brain naturally writes in Markdown

---

### It's supported by a lot of great apps

- Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio/RMarkdown support it out of the box

- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) is what I use for all the writing I control

- There are hundreds of other markdown editor apps

	- None of them have vendor lock-in, because it's plaintext (ðŸ¤¡)

- You can edit it using a boring command line text editor

	- `vim` and `emacs` both have strong packages for Markdown support

---

## Markdown sucks (a little)

---

### Markdown is a tiny specification

- Not all features are universally supported (e.g. footnotes)

- There are some non-standard specifications (e.g. Github flavored markdown)

	- There's now RFC 7763 and 7764 which standardize it

- It simply doesn't have some formatting things we want

---

### Missing pieces in Markdown

- Tables and ~~strikethrough~~ are unreliably implemented across platforms

- Colors and image styles require external CSS

- References aren't a thing

- You only get five levels of Section Heading

- Math formatting isn't universally allowed/respected

---

### Markdown requires another program to style it

- You can write all this wonderful semantically formatted text

	- But without help, it's just plaintext

- Like LaTeX, your documents need to be *compiled* to be pretty

	- So, you need to convert it to something else

---

### Markdown is designed for conversion

- Since Markdown is just a set of format specifiers, it's easy to turn into something else

- Technically, you could just convert it to any kind of formatting convention

	- Wait... omg

---

## Pandoc

---

### Pandoc is a document conversion program

- Written by John MacFarlane in 2006
	- A philosophy professor at UCB

- All it does it turn document formats from one thing to another

- Takes as input epub, HTML, JSON, LaTeX, Markdown, ODT, Office XML, Org Mode, Wiki Markup (among many more)

- Outputs the document as epub, HTML, InDesign, JSON, LaTeX, man, Markdown, ODT, Office XML, Org Mode, PDF, Plaintext, RTF, Slideshows (reveal, Beamer), Wiki

- That's all it does
	- Turns one format into another

---

### Pandoc will change your life

- "Oh, we need that TeX article in Word format" "Done."

- "Could you make your slides into an HTML single page sheet for note taking?"
	- [Here's this slideshow as a single page](https://savethevowels.org/talks/make_writing_suck_less_handout.html)

- "I have a markdown file, but I want it pretty and formatted like TeX"

- "I want to create all of my syllabi using markdown, and apply a custom format which makes them pretty HTML"
	- <https://savethevowels.org/101>
	- <https://savethevowels.org/113>

---

### Pandoc allows mixing of markup conventions!

- You can write mostly in Markdown, but intersperse a bit of HTML or LaTeX

- Pandoc will just see it, and pass it through

- If you convert to a format where the additional stuff is not supported, you'll just see the code

- **You can write mostly in Markdown, and then use LaTeX where you absolutely need LaTeX's power**

	- Write in Markdown with LaTeX, then have Pandoc LaTeXify it, then just make a PDF

---

### Markdown + LaTeX is wildly powerful

- 98% of the document is in a formatting language which is fast and easy to write

- 2% of the document does the 'power user' stuff

- You can use inline references, citations, and links to prior sections

- You get *all of the power of LaTeX, but you can write fluidly*

---

### This is how I wrote my dissertation, as well as many of my papers

- This allowed me to write ~70% of my dissertation on an iPad on a 1.5 hour bus ride to and from work

- I can revise a paper I'm working on *from my phone*

- You just compile it to LaTeX with Pandoc, and PDF it

- The only raw LaTeX I use is for writing Multiple Choice Exams

	- That's just because I haven't written code to turn Markdown into numbered questions and A-E responses

---

### You can also use different templates

- "Use this tex template to make this text a letter of recommendation"

- "Use this HTML template to make a page for my website"

- "This is a general document, just make a generic PDF"

- "Everything in this folder is slides, so stick my reveal.js header and footer to either side of it"

---

### Pandoc doesn't really suck

- It's a command line tool, which might suck a little for somebody for five minutes

- Install it using `brew` on Macs, using your package manager on Linux, and [there's a Windows installer too](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

- You'll also need a working LaTeX install to make it work for PDFs

- But once it's set up, it's beautiful

---

## This is my life now

---

### Everything is written in Markdown

- Using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md)

- Things that just need written down digitally stay in Obsidian
	- Effectively forming a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)
	- Here's [a great intro to that approach](https://www.soenkeahrens.de/en/takesmartnotes), SoÌˆnke Ahrens 'How to Take Smart Notes'

- Different folders for 'talks', 'docs', 'letters', 'offline', 'web' that need to be shared

---

### I use Pandoc to create polished documents where I need it

- Different templates for generic documents, websites, letters, slideshows, and more

- It's very easy to create a new document and have a pretty version of it quickly

---

### Let's get nerdy...

---

### [This Script](https://github.com/stylerw/scripts_and_dotfiles/blob/main/shell_scripts/gen_slides_docs_letters.sh) runs every thirty seconds

- It checks for changes in each of those folders

- It creates new html and PDFs of everything changed in `docs` and `offline` with a generic template
	- Docs gets uploaded to my website

- It renders changed things in `web` using my website HTML template and uploads them

- It creates new PDFs of everything changed in `letters` with an academic letter template

- It creates reveal.js slideshows and handouts for everything changed in `talks`

---

### This is the dream

- I sit, I write

	- ... and beautiful formatted documents just appear

- Formatting is as I desire, automatic, and sensible for the kind of document

- I can write a letter of recommendation using speech-to-text on my phone while walking home from the post office, and it's a formatted PDF when I get home

- And you change the format in one place, and all your documents change to match

- You spend no time on managing documents, formatting, or otherwise, just writing

---

### Writing always sucks a little

- But you can make it better by ensuring that your tools aren't adding to the suction
