# Gratitude

* All of our guest lecturers for their nerding

* Kevin and Niloo (alphabetically) for their help and support

* You all, for being here!

---

# Flashback!

---

### This class will teach you about Language, by talking about languages.

* Goal 1: Learn how linguists talk about Language

* Goal 2: Learn about the incredible diversity of language in the world

* Goal 3: Learn about the life cycle of languages

* Goal 4: Talk about languages!

* Goal 5: Turn you all into Linguists.


---

# How'd we do?

---

## Goal 1: "Learn how linguists talk about Language"

---

> Ojibwe is an Algonquian dialect continuum of the Great Lakes region.  It's polysynthetic, VSO/VOS, with heavy use of animacy, evidentiality, and modality.  Phonologically, a seven vowel system is used, with both vowel length and nasality contrastive.

* ### OMG! We can understand that gibberish!

---

### Success!

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/celebration_fey.gif"> 

---

## Goal 2: "Learn about the incredible diversity of language in the world"

---

### People will say stupid things to you.

* "Translators are overpaid. All they do is remember different words in other languages."

* "German's easy, it has most of the same sounds as English."

* "Oh, come on. Indian can't be endangered, there are 300 reservations worth of speakers!"

* "English is the hardest/easiest/original language."

---

### You can smack them down!

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/who-is-awesome.jpg"> 

---

## Goal 3: "Learn about the life cycle of languages"

---

### You can now explain...

* What language death is

* What language revitalization is

* Why languages tend to die in the first place

* Why that's a bad thing.

---

### That's more than 99% of the world population knows!

* ... And you're a better citizen of the world for it!

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/carltondance.gif"> 

---

## Goal 4: "Talk about languages!"

---

### You can now name more languages than 90% of Americans

* ... and you can talk intelligently about them too!

* This doesn't seem like much, but...

---

### **People *love* when you know something about their language!**

* "You're the first person I've ever known who's heard of Amharic!"
	
* "Every other American thinks Iranian people speak Arabic!  Thank you!"

* "Oh, yeah, Russian's hard.  You guys are all about that Case!"

	* ðŸŽ¶ "We're bringing Dative baaaaack, why don't you tell them Romance speakers that." ðŸŽ¶
	
	* ðŸŽ¶ "I know y'all use noun claaass..." ðŸŽ¶
	
---

### You're there to tell them that every foreign tongue is perfect from the bottom to the top

* (because it is.)

* Seriously, you get a lot of mileage out of "Oh, ____, that's a beautiful language!"

---

... also...

---

### You know lots more about different cultures now, too!

* You know why the Chechens and Russians don't see eye-to-eye

	* Same with the Basque, Uighur, Kurds, etc.
	
* You know that there was more than one Native American group

	* (You'd be surprised, in Boulder...)

* You know that not all Africans are Khoisan language speakers

	* (and that all the rest don't speak Swahili)

---

### You know weird things now!

* You know that Stalin didn't speak Russian well

* "I speak Hebrew!" "Awesome, I love conlangs!  Do you speak Klingon too?"

* You know that Simba is named "Lion"

* You know that everything in Chipotle is Nahuatl

	* [Except the art.](http://www.languagejones.com/blog-1/2014/11/10/language-jones-and-the-temple-ofburritos)
	
* You know that we've stolen half our state names from Indigenous languages

## Goal 5: "Turn you all into Linguists."

<img class="big" src="humorimg/missionaccomplished.png">

* Right?

### Oh, some of you don't yet know that you want to declare a LING Major!

---

Taking this class was a *great* first step!

---

### You've got a *huge* advantage in LING 2000

* We covered a lot of similar material, just from a very different perspective

* Seriously, take LING 2000.  You'll need it for the major

	* ... which you've already declared

---

### ... and in every other Linguistics class

* We've covered elements of Language Sound Structures (LING 3100)

* ... and World Language Policies (LING 3545)

* ... and Morphosyntax (LING 4420)

* ... and Language and Culture (LING 4800)

* ... and American Indian Languages (LING ____)

---

### Did I mention the LING Major and Minor are pretty small?

* Especially if you're taking a foreign language already!

* Email Deanna Fierman for more information on declaring

	* Fierman@colorado.edu
	
* (You can't blame a guy for trying, right?)

---

### OK, OK, maybe you're not *all* going to declare a LING major

* ... but I've still warped all of your brains!

---

### You'll be weirdly interested in people speaking another language on the street

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/upsquirrellanguage.png">

---

### Hearing an ejective in the wild will make your day.

* (Seriously, you laugh now, but when you hear one...)

---

### You're *much* better equipped to learn another language

* "So, this language does something *reallllllly* exotic..."

	* Dude, it's just case.  Cool your jets.

* "Can we just drop the pretense and look at a pronoun chart?"

---

### You're also better equipped to handle the uninformed

* "We need somebody to offer customer support in Hmong. Let's just buy Sandy a Rosetta Stone CD."

* "Translator?  I'll just write the letter in English, then use Google Translate before I send it to them!"

* "Anja's from Sweden, and Sweden's right next to Finland, so she should be able to rewrite the manual in Finnish."

* "Of course the savage languages are going to be endangered.  They can't express civilized concepts!"

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/comeatmebro.jpg"> 

---

### You're going to be more sympathetic to non-Native speakers of English

* Because seriously, English, go home, you're drunk.

---

### ... and you'll be kinder to yourself when you screw up another language

* Because that language is drunk too.

---

... but most importantly of all...

---

You understand that even though people around the world all use it differently...

* # Language is magic

---

### Go be wizards!

<huge>Thank you very much!</huge>
