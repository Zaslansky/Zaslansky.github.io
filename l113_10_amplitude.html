### Exam Accommodations folks, talk to me now!

- Midterm is next week!

- Study guide is online, as is a sample of what the exam's format will look like.  See <https://savethevowels.org/docs/l113_studyguide.html>

- 41 questions, fill-in-the-blank and short answer, given in 50 minutes.  

- I reserve the right to 'curve' the exam or not, as seems appropriate based on the grade distribution

# Amplitude and Decibels

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- Filtering

- Measuring Sound Pressure

- Distance and Pressure

- Units for measuring pressure

- Decibels

- Amplitude related hearing damage!

---

# Filtering

---

### We're just going to give you four terms

- **High Pass**

	- "Let frequencies higher than this pass"

- **Low Pass**

	- "Let frequencies lower than this pass"

- **Band Pass**

	- "Let frequencies in this band pass"

- **Band Stop** (also 'Band Reject' and 'Notch')

	- "Let only frequencies outside this band pass"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/filtering.jpg">">

---

### Filters aren't perfect

- They always have a 'cutoff' and a 'slope'

	- Your book calls slope 'rejection rate', but you'll also hear 'roll-off'

- The slope dictates how quickly sounds outside the cutoff are attenuated

- **There's no such thing as a perfect filter**

	- Where the slope is vertical
    
---

### Filtering is important!

- It's a part of lots of hearing aids' and CIs' processing

- We can model hearing loss by filtering

- It's a basic component of signal processing

---

### ... and now, for something completely different

---

### Now we've talked about all the basic properties of sounds

- As well as the process of combining them and modifying them

- Now, how should we measure that Y-axis anyways?

---

# Amplitude

---

### Sound Amplitude is pressure

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

- Greater compression, greater amplitude

---

## Measuring Sound Pressure

---

## Where do we measure on the wave?

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/amplitude_rms.jpg">

---

### We use Root-Mean-Square Amplitude

- Eliminates asymmetry between up and down

- Takes the mean amplitude for the sound overall!

- This captures the fact that sounds often vary in amplitude!

---

## How far away do I measure from?

---

### Distance matters!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/amplitude_vsdistance.jpg">

- If the distance from the source is doubled, pressure is cut in half!

---

### There's a bit more to it than this!

- Moving the medium damps sound independently of this

	- Lower frequencies are damped less in air, hence seeming to 'travel' farther

- Vertical differences in air temperature can 'bend' sound up and down

	- When the air is warmer near the ground, sound bends upwards

---

### We know this to be true!

- Distant sounds are quieter

- You don't feel the pressure bursts from distant fireworks

- There is a 'safe distance' from an explosion

---

### Amplitude measures without distances are meaningless

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/amplitude_75dblimit.jpg">

---

### Amplitude measures without distances are meaningless

- Anything's safe for hearing if you're far enough away

	- "Just grab their measurement device and walk 'til it's legal"

- So, it's critical to give amplitudes with a distance

	- "20 Pascal at 1 meter"
	- "... measured at 90dB at 2 meters from the source"
	- "Less than 50dB at the property boundary"

---



## OK, so what units should we use?

---

### Let's start with a simple unit

- **Pascal** - Newtons per square meter

- Where a newton is the force required to move a kilogram 1 meter per second per second

---

### What's zero sound pressure?

- Nothing really is

- Quietest places on Earth (anechoic chambers) are ~1.9x10<sup>-6</sup> Pascal

- The quietest 1kHz sound we can hear is 2.00×10<sup>−5</sup> Pascal

- **We're humans, so we're choosing the human audibility threshold as 'zero'**

---

### What's the maximum pressure?

- The Planck Pressure?

	- The highest possible force in the smallest possible area

	- 4.63309*10<sup>113</sup> Pascal

- In Earth's atmosphere, the loudest possible waves are around 1.01x10<sup>5</sup> (101000) Pascal

- Humans experience pain in the 200 Pascal Range

- Humans experience long term hearing damage > 0.36 Pascal

---

### So our range as humans is...

- 200 Pascal highest tolerable sound with pain

- 63 Pascal for a trumpet half a meter away

- 20 Pascal can cause instant hearing damage

- 2 Pascal for a jackhammer a meter away

- 0.36 Pascal causes hearing damage over long term exposure

- 0.02 Pascal for a home TV a meter away

- 0.002 for conversation

- 0.00002 Pascal lowest detectable sound by humans

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/side_eye_chloe.jpg">

---

## That's kind of awful

- Most of the scale is used for 'too damned loud'

- Any time you're using 0.00002, you're going to make mistakes

---

## Enter the Decibel!

- Decibels are logarithmic

- We'll use dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level) 

- We use a reference value of 0.00002 Pascal

	- The lowest audible amplitude
    
---

### dB SPL can be calculated from Pascal

- dB = 20*log10(Pascal/0.00002)

	- log10 is NOT the same thing as log or ln!
	- This will mess up your homeworks!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/dB_vs_pascal.jpg">

---

### So our range as humans is...

- 140dB highest tolerable sound with pain

- 130dB for a trumpet half a meter away

- 120dB can cause hearing damage instantly

- 100dB for a jackhammer a meter away

- 85dB causes hearing damage over long term exposure

- 60dB for a home TV a meter away

- 20dB for conversation

- 0dB lowest detectable sound by humans

- -20dB Anechoic Chamber Quiet

---

### Yes, dB can be negative!

- Remember, 0 is our threshold for hearing!

	- ... and we're not all that good at hearing quiet things

---

## Decibels and Damage

---

### High Amplitude sounds cause hearing damage!

- 180+dB can break the TM and/or dislocate the ossicles

- Sounds over 132dB can rip the organ of corti off the basilar membrane

- Long term high amplitude sounds damage the stereocilia and can cause cell death

---

### What are the 'safe' levels?

- [Let's Ask ASHA](https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/loud-noise-dangers/)

    - The American Speech Language Hearing Association
    
---

### What are 'safe' levels?

- < 70 dB is *absolutely fine!*

- 70-85 dB is fine *in short doses < 8 hours*

- 85+ dB has the safe exposure time cut in half per 3 dB

	- So 91 dB is OK for only 2 hours
    
- OSHA requires hearing protection for anything over 90 dB

- Over 120dB is **not safe for any amount of time**

	- This is *instant damage!*

---

### Instant Damage Sounds

- 140-190dB for a gunshot, firecracker, artillery, nearby fireworks

- 150dB for Jet Engines and firecrackers and dynamite blasts

- Over 130dB causes **immediate pain!**

- 130dB for auto racing, jackhammers

- Over 120dB can cause **instant hearing damage**

- 110-120dB is thunder, stadia, chainsaws

- Most rock concerts are 110-120dB!

---

### Gradually damaging sounds

- 105+ dB for unmuffled motorcycles

- 90-100dB is very possible with headphones and background noise

- 80-90dB is common on busy streets and in subways

- Restaurants can easily reach 90dB

- 85dB can cause damage with long-term exposure

	- Blenders, Smoke Alarms, Hand Saws, and Machining tools can easily be in this range!

---

### Acoustical laws!

- In San Diego...

	- Residential Zoned Areas have a limit of 60 dB at the property line
	- Commercial Zoned Areas have a limit of 65 dB at the property line
	- Industrial Zoned Areas have a limit of 75 dB at the property line
    
- California limits motorcycles to 80dB (modern) and 92dB (pre-1970)

- California law limits vehicle noise to 95dB

- **Both motorcycles and cars are measured at 50 feet from centerline of travel!**

- *This presentation does not constitute legal advice*

---

### OSHA Requirements

- [OSHA has standards for noise exposure](https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.95)

---

> When information indicates that any employee's exposure may equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels, the employer shall develop and implement a monitoring program.

---

> The employer shall establish and maintain an audiometric testing program as provided in this paragraph by making audiometric testing available to all employees whose exposures equal or exceed an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels.


---

> Employers shall make hearing protectors available to all employees exposed to an 8-hour time-weighted average of 85 decibels or greater at no cost to the employees. Hearing protectors shall be replaced as necessary.

---

### Be careful with your hearing!

- If you work in a loud setting, ask about the hearing plan

	- [Many restaurants exceed the OSHA levels!](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753563/#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20sound%20levels,(PEL)%20of%2090%20dBA.&text=These%20studies%20concluded%20that%20environmental,85%20dBA%20during%20operating%20hours.)

- Use noise reducing earplugs at concerts

- When you're up against serious noise, double up

	- Earmuff style over foam plugs is more effective still!

	- Remember that electronic earmuffs are a thing
    
---

### Every action hero would be completely deaf

- There is *so* much hearing damage in movies

- Seriously, do not fire guns in enclosed spaces without hearing protection

---

# Be careful with your hearing!

- It doesn't "come back" if you damage it!

---

## One other kind of dB

---

### About that threshold!

- We'd said that 0dB/0.00002 Pascal is the lowest detectable sound

- This isn't quite true!

---

### Sound Detection is frequency dependent!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/amplitude_vsfrequency.jpg">

---

### This leads to the use of 'dB HL'

- 'Decibels of Hearing Loss'

- 0 dB HL is the normal hearing threshold **at a given frequency**

### This means that hearing tests aren't done in dB SPL

- We wouldn't want 'normal' to look like a weird curvy line

- This way, hearing loss is expressed in terms of 'relative to normal hearing'

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/audiogram_2016_left.jpg">

---

### So, we'll talk about pressures in dB SPL

- ... and we'll talk about hearing loss in dB HL

---

## Do the reading!

- The book goes deeper into the math of dB than I'm going to here

	- It also covers resonance, which I'm not getting into here

---

### Next time

- How do we capture, measure, and play sound back?
