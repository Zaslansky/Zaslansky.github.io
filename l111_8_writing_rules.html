### "Surface Allophones" vs. Phonemes

- Every sound comes to the surface as an allophone

- You never produce a phoneme, just the surface allophone which has the same form as the underlying phoneme.

- "These two sounds are phonemes" is not the most accurate phrasing

    - "These two sounds represent two different phonemes"
    
- It's a nitpick, but it's a nit I should be better at picking.

---

### It's "Complementary" distribution, not "Complimentary"

- This is Will's very favorite typo

- Allophones form a complementary set, which completely cover the options

- Allophones do not tell you that your hair looks great today

---

# Writing Phonological Rules (well) 

### Will Styler - LIGN 111

---

### Today's Plan

- Writing phonological rules

- Writing *graceful* phonological rules

---
# Phonological Rules

---

### So, you've figured out that sounds are allophones of the same phoneme!

- They're in a *complementary* distribution

- You can predict which one will show up based on the environment

- **How do I express that prediction to somebody else?**

---

### Phonological Rules

You describe the distribution of the allophones of a phoneme with phonological rules

---


### First, a note on notation

- We're going to differentiate words in IPA between // and []

- /tap/ means 'top' at an abstract level ('Underlying form').

- [tap] means that sequence of sounds at a surface level ('Surface form').

- /tap/ exists in the speaker's mind, [tap] exits a person's mouth

- More later...

---

### Transformation has a format

- We need to know what it starts as

- What it turns into

- And when that transformation takes place

---

/Starting State/ -> [Ending State] / [When the transformation happens]

---

### /Remus Lupin/ -> [Wolf] / [Full moon]

![](img/lupin.jpg)

---

### /Optimus Prime/ -> [Truck] / [Time to Roll Out]

![](img/optimus.jpg)

---

### For ANY transformation, you want to know...

- What it starts out as

- What it ends up as

- What conditions or environment triggers it

---

### Phonological Rule Format

- "X turns into Y in environment Z"

- “X -> Y” means “X turns into Y”

    - -> is an arrow.  -> is just easy to type.

- Then the “/” which means “in the environment”

- Then you add a blank, representing where the sound goes that's getting transformed  “__”

- ... And you position that blank relative to the conditioning environment.

---

### For now, you can use natural classes, or features

- Once we've learned features, we're going to have you use them

- I'll present both

---

### If /n/ turns to an /ŋ/ before dorsal consonants...

- /n/ -> [ŋ]  / __ [dorsal C]

- If it happened after dorsal sounds...

- /n/ -> [ŋ]  / [dorsal C] __

---

### Some Basic Phonological Rules

- Bruce Wayne --> Batman / [Crime]__[Crime]

- /t/ -> /t̪/ /__[dental C]

- /ej/ -> [ej:] / __[+voice]

- /V/ -> [Ṽ] / __[+nasal]

---

### Word Boundaries

- "#" indicates a word boundary

- Words *actually* look like [#kʰæt#ʃoʊ#]

- The environment "__#" means "at the end of the word"

    - "Right before the word boundary"
    
- The environment "#__" means "at the start of the word"

    - "Right after the word boundary"
    
- Same thing goes for syllable (".") and morpheme ("+") boundaries

---

### Other Symbols

- “V” means “any vowel” 

- “C” means “any consonant”

- "ø" means "Nothing"

- α β γ are used for matching

---

### Insertion/Deletion

- "ø" means "Nothing"

- /t/ -> ø / __#

    - "t disappears at the end of the word"

- ø -> [t] / V__V

    - "t appears any time two vowels are directly adjacent"
    
---

### Alpha notation

- "These sounds should match for this feature"

- /n/ -> [ŋ] / __[Velar C]

- /n/ -> [n̪] / __[Dental C]

- /n/ -> [m] / __[Bilabial C]

- /n/ -> [n] / __[Alveolar C]

- /n/ -> [αplace] / __[C αplace]

---

### Sonorants match the nasality of the preceding C

- [+son] -> [αnasal] / [+cons, αnasal]__

---

### Alpha Notation

- You can use α β γ (and so forth) for any features

- If you just need one, use [α] (Greek letter alpha)

- If you need to match on two independent features, use [β]

- "Given two vowels of the same height, the second vowel is rounded if and only if the first vowel is rounded."
    
    - [+syll, αhigh] → [βround] / [αhigh, βround]__

---

### Set Notation

- Groups of sounds can be presented as ordered sets

- /p t k/ -> [ɸ θ x] / V__#

    - This is different from /p t k/ -> [θ x ɸ] / V__#

---

### Feature Matrices

- Sometimes, you need to list multiple features

- One approach: ![](phonology/bracketed_features.jpg)

- The other: ø -> [+syll,+high,+front,-round] / [+strid]__[+strid,+cont]

- **These two rules say the same thing.  They are equivalent.**

- I'll post a fancy bracketing in word guide on Canvas

---

### Don't forget the brackets

- V -> [+nasal] / [Nasal C]__

- V -> [+nasal] / NasalC__

---

### Parentheses mark optional elements

- /d/ -> [z] / __(C)#

    - "d becomes z before a word boundary, or before a C followed by a word boundary"

- V -> [αround] / [+syll, αround](C)__

    - Vowels match the rounding of the previous vowel, even if there's an intervening consonant

- V -> [αround] / [+syll, αround]([-syll,-nasal])__

    - Vowels match the rounding of the previous vowel, even if there's an intervening non-nasal consonant

---

## Let's Practice!

---

### Formalize the following rules

(Assume that groupings represent complete natural classes)

1: /d/ becomes a /n/ immediately after a nasal vowel

2: /i/ and /u/ become /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ at the end of the word, even if there's a nasal before the word's end.

3: /d/ will turn into /b/ or /d/ or /g/ when after /m/ or /n/ or /ŋ/, respectively

4: A glottal stop is inserted between any two vowels with matching rounding

5: All consonants except /m/ or /n/ or /ŋ/ are deleted word finally

6: /p/ turns into /b/ at the start of a monosyllabic CV word, with any vowel

---

### 1: /d/ becomes a /n/ immediately after a nasal vowel

- /d/ -> [n] / [V +nas]__

---

### 2: /i/ and /u/ become /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ at the end of the word, even if there's a nasal before the word's end.

- /i u/ ->  [ɪ ʊ] / __([C +nasal])#

- [+syll, +high, +ATR] ->  [-ATR] / __([-syll, +nas])#

    - Whoa, features are powerful!

---

### 3: /d/ will turn into /b/ or /d/ or /g/ when after /m/ or /n/ or /ŋ/, respectively

- /d/ -> [αplace] / [C +nasal, αplace]__

---

### 4: A glottal stop is inserted between any two vowels with matching rounding

- ø -> [ʔ] / [V αround]__[V αround]

---

### 5: All consonants except /m/ or /n/ or /ŋ/ are deleted word finally

- [C -nasal] -> ø / __#

---

### 6: /p/ turns into /b/ at the start of a monosyllabic CV word

- /p/ -> [b] / #__V#

---

## ... but wait

- How do you decide what goes on the left side of the rule?

---

# Choosing Underlying forms

---

### When you write rules in this way, you need to decide on an underlying form

- "How is this word 'stored'?"

- "What elements of this word can I not predict?"

- "What don't I want to deal with in this analysis?"

---

### All words have surface and underlying forms

- The surface forms contain the final form of the word

- The underlying forms contain only the unpredictable information

- The underlying forms *must* contain the information which your rules cannot predict

---

### Sometimes, the surface form is the same as the UR

- 'Dot' /dat/ -> [dat]

- 'Eat' /it/ -> [it]

- No rules apply!

---

### Sometimes, the surface form contains predictable differences!

- 'Dog' /dag/ -> [da:g]
    
    - /V/ -> [V:] / __[C +voice]
    
- 'Cat' /kæt/ -> [kʰæt]

    - Aspiration Rule

- **We don't need to store the predictable stuff**
    
---

### Sometimes, there's a lot of predictable stuff

- 'Planes' /plejn+z/ -> [pʰl̥ẽj̃nz]

    - Nasalization
    - Aspiration
    - Approximant devoicing
    - Plural allomorphy
    
- ... but the underlying form remains pretty plain

- ![](humorimg/badpundog.jpg)

---

### When choosing a UR, you always want to include the unpredictable stuff

- ... and you want to make your life easier

---

### Sometimes, your rules will be much simpler if you choose one UR over the other

- [l] and [r] alternate, and are about equally common

- [l] occurs before /ɛ ɡ n ɱ œ ʠ h w x ʤ ᴢ β æ m/

- [r] occurs before /i/

- /l/ -> [r] / __i

- /r/ -> [l] / [*loud sobbing*]

---

### Always choose as the underlying phoneme that which makes your analysis better

- URs are like Goblin steel: They absorb only what strengthens your analysis

---

### ... but wait, what do you mean by 'better'?

---

# Writing Phonological Rules Well

---

### Phonology has 'good' answers and 'bad' answers which are both correct

---

### A bad analysis of the English plural

- /s/ -> [z] / At the end of the words dog, pub, rag, dad, bin...

- /s/ -> [s] / At the end of the words cat, buck, cliff, myth...

- /s/ -> [ɪz] / At the end of words dish, fish, kiss, plus, judge...

---

### A slightly less bad analyis of the English plural

- /s/ -> [z] / [j,g, d, ɹ, n, w, b, m, l, i, aj, v, u, oʊ...]__

- /s/ -> [s] / [t, p, k, f, θ...]__

- /s/ -> [ɪz] / [tʃ, dʒ, s, ʃ, z]__

---

### A decent analysis of the English plural

- /s/ -> [z] / [C +voice]__

- /s/ -> [ɪz] / [strident C]__

- /s/ -> [s] / Elsewhere

    - (You don't need to write the 'elsewhere' rule)
    
- There's a better approach, we'll cover it later

---

### We can talk about the elegance of a solution

- An elegant solution will have a good balance of fit, complexity, and generality

- **Fit**: How well does the analysis fit the data?

- **Generality**: How much of the available data does it describe? Does it capture general patterns?

- **Complexity**: Is there a way to handle the data which is less complex than the one you're proposing?

- **Redundancy**: Does it provide unnecessary information, or redundantly specify features?

---

### Fit

- An analysis which doesn't fit the data isn't a good analysis

- Always make sure there are no datapoints which break your analysis

- This needs to come first

- If you can explain every form but one, you're not done

    - In this class.  But exceptions do happen.

---

### Generality

- You don't want to write five rules for five processes when you can write one

- Combine rules where you can

- This hardens your analysis against wugs and loanwords

- Most phonological rules deal in features or natural classes

- If you're writing three rules for three similar processes, ask yourself questions

    - Look for shared features or patterns

---

### Complexity

- An analysis should be as simple as possible

- Given two analyses which are functionally equivalent, the smaller one is better

- Some analyses are complex, but always ask yourself if you can do the job with fewer moving parts

---

### Check for redundancy

- You do not need to tell us that these sonorants are voiced

- You do not need to say that alveolar sounds are coronal

- If one more person tells me about a stop consonant, I'm going to cry

---

### Check for Redundancy

---

### We will be grading elegance on homeworks

- It won't be a huge part of your grade

- An inelegant solution is better than none at all

- We understand that you're still learning

- ... but do your best to make your analysis elegant

---

### Always try to break your rules

- Treat the rule as a hypothesis, then look for the data that doesn't follow it

- If it breaks down, tweak or abandon

- For LIGN 111, if your rule doesn't work with one of the words in the dataset, your rule doesn't work

---

### Wrapping up

- Learn phonological rule notation

- Choose your URs carefully and strategically

- Write elegant rules, please!

---

### Next time

- We'll play with underlying forms in some very interesting data!
