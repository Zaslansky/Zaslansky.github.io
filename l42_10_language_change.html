# Language Change
### Will Styler - LIGN 42

---

### Today's Plan

- What is language change?

- What about language can change?

- What causes language change?

---

## What is language change?

---

### Language change is just what it sounds like

- "Time-based shifts in a language's features"

- This can affect *any* element of the grammar or lexicon of language

---

### Language change is a *constant process*

- It is largely unpreventable

	- 'A grammarian trying to stop language change is like a gardener trying to stop continental drift'
	
	- Some organizations ([lol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_Fran%C3%A7aise) and [rofl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Spanish_Academy)) try
	
- There is no moment when any language is not shifting

- Only dead languages stop changing

---

### Change occurs gradually

- Often starting in smaller communities and spreading to general populations

- Today's sociolinguistic variation could be tomorrow's language change

- Occasionally happens from the top down

	- New term for the Czech Republic just dropped
	
---

## What elements of language change?

---

### How have you noticed language change within your lifetime?

---

### How is your language different from the Boomers (born 1946-64)?

---

### Many linguistic elements change

- Any element of grammar is a potential element of change

- Some elements have more resistance to change

	- Writing systems are now conventionalized and uniformity is enforced (e.g. spellcheck, autocorrect)

	- Content words (nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives) change more than function words (prepositions, affixes, determiners, pronouns, conjunctions...)
	
---

### Sound Change (Phonetics and Phonology)

- Shifts in speech sound pronunciation

	- Dude as [dud] vs. [du̟ːːːːd]
	
- Addition or loss of individual sounds

	- Knight is no longer /knixt/

- Shifts in the rules governing sounds

	- [Afrikaans is now a tone language, but only for younger speakers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095447016300894)

- **What sound changes have you seen?**

---

### Spelling Change

- Changes to word spellings

	- Color vs. Colour, womyn, womxn, latinx, thi[cc](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-cc)

- Changes to usage of the writing system

    - The loss of two spaces after periods, capitalization/punctuation norms, use of emoji

- Development of a new writing system

    - The [Arabic Chat Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet) / Arabizi
	
- **What spelling changes have you seen?**

---

### Syntactic and Other Grammatical Change

- Changes to the syntactic structures of the language (e.g. 'Peas, I like' or 'Bought a car, he did!')

- Gain or loss of major grammatical functions (e.g. cases, markings)

- **Have you seen this?**

---

### Lexical Change

- Addition of new words and morphemes

	- 'zoomer', 'covidiot', 'enshittification'

- The loss or fading of words and morphemes

	- '-en', 'inflammable', 'vitriol', 'retarded'

- **We've talked all about new words this quarter!**

---

### Semantic Shift

- Word meanings becoming *broader* (e.g. 'socialist')

- Word meanings becoming *narrower* (e.g. 'liberal')

- Word meanings becoming *more negative* ('pejoration') (e.g. 'retarded' or 'handicapped')

- Word meanings becoming *more positive* ('amelioration') (e.g. 'renegade')

- Word meanings becoming *entirely different* (e.g. 'spam')

- **What semantic shifts have you seen?**

---

### Any other kinds of change we didn't classify?

---

## What causes language change?

---

### Common Causes of language change

- Change to the culture/world

	- COVID-related vocab
	
- Economy and Ease

	- 'why waste time say lot word when few word do trick'
	
- Semantic Shifts

	- Once 'retarded' became a negative term, we needed a new term which was more neutral
	
- Language Contact

	- Languages in direct contact influence each other
	
- **Which of these have you seen?**
	
---

### More causes

- Social Changes and migrations

	- When the Russian nobility had to learn Russian during the Napoleonic wars...

- Analogy and Reanalysis

	- 'Huh, Children... oxen... oven... nice ov!'
	
- Change during learning

	- Complicated, unpredictable, or opaque language features may not be learned by kids
	
- **Which of these have you seen?**

---

### Change is inevitable

- Luckily, it's generally great!

- Language often drifts towards learnability

	- It moves with changing cultures
	
	- ... and prepares us to talk about the future

# The Class Meme

---

### One meme which encapsulates the LIGN 42 2024 Experience

- See #the-class-meme on Discord

- Take the last person's post and build on it

	- "I'm working on it now, thx"

- Anything goes (within the content guidelines)

### Here's last year's
