# Features!

### Will Styler - LIGN 111

---

### Today's Plan

- Phonological Features

---

### Lists of segments aren't great

- They're inefficient

- They obscure relations among segments

- We can do better

---

### Natural Classes are better!

- They represent common groupings of sounds

- They're more efficient than lists

- They get at the idea that some rules apply to groups because of some shared characteristic

---

### ... but why are natural classes natural?

- What unites /w ɹ j/ as approximants?

- Why are /m n ɲ ŋ/ grouped?

- What's the meaningful link between [pʰ tʰ kʰ]?

    - Why do we treat them as different from [p t k] in English?
    
    - ... or from [b d g]?

---

### These differences in groups matter to speakers

- Languages place these groups in opposition

- In English, [pʰ tʰ kʰ] are different from [p t k]

    - ... but [p t k] and [b d g] aren't in opposition
    
- In Spanish, [p t k] are different from [b d g]

    - ... but [pʰ tʰ kʰ] and [p t k] aren't in opposition

---

### But is this actually about groups of sounds?

- In Spanish, [p t k] AND [pʰ tʰ kʰ] are different from [b d g]

- **This sure seems to be about voicing**

- In English, [pʰ tʰ kʰ] are different from [p t k] AND [b d g]

- **Could we say that this contrast is about aspiration (greater glottal airflow)?**

---

### English vowels are nasalized before /m n ŋ/

- So, it's before nasal sounds?

- ... but also before [ɾ̃] as in "winter"

- **This is about nasality!**

---

### It's often easier to talk not about the classes of sounds, but the more abstract features that make the classes distinct

- Which is why we're going to use...

---

## Phonological Features

---

## Phonological Features

Abstract representations of the properties of sounds which make them phonologically distinct in languages

---

### Features have three main principles

- They capture linguistic contrasts

- They are what natural classes are made of

- They're phonetically grounded

---

### Features capture contrasts

- In Spanish, stops contrast on the basis of [+/- voice]

- In English, vowel nasality is triggered only by [+nasal] sounds

- Feature theories are designed to capture the contrasts present in languages

---

### Features are the underpinnings of natural classes

- Sounds in a natural class share features

- This is the nature of a natural class

---

### Features are phonetically meaningful

- Phonetic realization remains a crucial part of sounds' phonological nature

---

## Features in Practice

---

### Features can be unary or binary

- Unary features have one state (e.g. [+coronal])

- Binary features have two states (e.g. [+voice] or [-voice])

---

### Features overlap across segments and segment types

- Each feature describes many segments

- ... but every segment can be specified using one specific combination

---

### Sounds can be specified as a series of features

![](phonology/map_features.jpg)

---

### We can 'toggle' or change individual features as a part of rules

- [-sonorant] -> [-voice] / __#

- [-cont] -> [+nasal] / V__V

---

### Features can also trigger rules

- [+syllabic] -> [+nasal] / __[+nasal]

- [-cont, +coronal] -> ∅ / __[+lateral]

---

## One important note!

---

### Feature Sets are theory!

- You can split sounds up in many different ways

- Each approach will have some benefits, and some downsides

---

### A certain feature theory will describe the entire set of sounds in play

- Every sound is specified in terms of distinctive features

- ... but some sets will use different features to do it

---

### There are many proposed feature theories

- We're going to use a relatively vanilla set of features

- Designed to work effectively in a variety of problems across languages

- ... but there are other approaches

- **Please use the feature specifications we've given you for this class!**

---

### Will was trained in a different theory!

- ... but he wants you to learn the local standard

- If you see him pausing or checking the chart, that's what's up!

---

## Now, let's talk about the feature set we're using!

---

### Wrapping up

- Features allow us to access some of the contrasts made in language directly.

- We can use features to write our rules more elegantly

- From here out, you'll want to use features to write your rules

- Language seems to use features, so we will too!

---

### Next time

- We'll get some practice applying features to sounds and rules
