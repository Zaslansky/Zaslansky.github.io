# Computational Speech Processing

### Will Styler - LIGN 168

---

### Today's Plan

- What's (probably) next for computational speech processing

- What have we learned?

- What does this all teach us about language?

---

# What's (probably) next for computational speech processing

---

### We don't know what's next 

- We barely know what the computational speech processing world will look like in 2025

- Look back later in your career and laugh at how many things I got wrong
	- Maybe I'll even get a few things right!

- ... but my track record isn't amazing

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/nlp_clown.jpg">

---

### Let's give it a shot anyways!

---

### Deep Neural Networks will keep winning for NLP

- Unless something better emerges, for wealthy languages, DNNs have won

- There's not serious competition in ASR, TTS, Denoising, and otherwise

- Improvements to LLMs will likely mean even stronger performance
	- This may just be in terms of greater complexity and parameter counts

---

### NLP will happen on other people's computers for a while

- Unless we can improve on the compute/memory constraints, these will not be affordable to run at home

	- Many shareholders will be wealthier if those improvements don't happen

- Remote models are closed by design, and privacy policies cannot be reasonably confirmed or trusted

- Paywalls and data harvesting will continue to be the norm

- **As a result...**

---

### Speech Processing (and AI) will be bastions of inequality

- When core language technologies are kept proprietary and closed, they will only be available to people with money
	- Nobody will bother making good consumer ASR in minoritized languages and dialects

- This will further incentivize use of wealthy languages
	- ... and further increase economic pressures towards language dormancy

- If you need to speak American English or Mandarin to interact with computers most efficiently, *this is a substantial problem*

---

### Yet there is hope!

---

### We've seen open tools form infrastructure before

- Open codecs are often preferable and quickly adopted
	- Unless you're trying to lock consumers into a particular ecosystem

- Compression tools tend to be open, as they should be

- Praat is free and open, as are most Python libraries

- Linux is the only serious operating system for deploying 'AI' models

---

### Open Models can win

- ['They have no moat'](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)
	- This is partly why we're seeing companies pushing for protective regulation

- Major open models can still be competitive, as they build on each other!
	- Running them remains a logistical hurdle

- Open models have strong equity benefits
	- It's not possible to fine tune a closed model for a smaller speech community

- Any regulation which enshrines serious privacy will need to also force transparency
	- This will favor open code and open weights

---

### "OK, we get it Linux boy. Open is good."

- My bad, rant slipped out.

- Back to more concrete predictions...

---

### Linguists will shift their focus to validation and understanding

- Even as building the models is increasingly statistical and Computer Science, studying them will remain linguistic

- We'll use the same tools we've always used to understand speech-using humans, to understand speech-using computers

- We'll learn how these models work by treating them like we already treat black-box language users

---

### More models will be multi-modal by design

- Multiple encoders allow multiple kinds of input
	- We're likely already seeing this with GPT-4o

- Separate ASR models could be replaced with speech encoders as an input to a general language model
	- Why bother with two tasks and models when one could do?

- TTS will probably continue being its own task in the pipeline for a bit longer
	- There's less to be gained from direct-to-TTS output

---

### ASR may become a subtask of LLMs

- Whisper's end-to-end, intergrated-LM model is unlikely to be an anomaly

- Powerful ability to predict the next word is... uh... useful for ASR

- This will help with many of the remaining world inference issues
	- e.g. Taking a wok from the Chinese restaurant

---

### TTS may move towards true end-to-end learning

- Increases in memory or compute power will allow direct mapping from text to wave
	- The same could come from algorithmic improvements

- Mel spectrogram vocoders will be adorable in retrospect
	- An artifact of a time where we could do better than parameters, but waves were too much

- This will cause improvements in handling of difficult dialect issues
	- Text analysis will be a part of the learned embedding
	- Emotion will also be more 'human' as models predict tone alongside text

---

### This may lead to dialect embeddings

- Current speaker adaptation approaches struggle with (e.g.) phone substitutions or major prosodic differences

- Embeddings based on (and affecting) models which include text analysis, prosody, and more will allow more robust dialect differences to be mapped

- This technology may be useful for sociolinguistic inquiry, broadly
	- ... and studying them could be wildly interesting!

---

### Speech Technologies will become more embedded in our lives

- We will become quickly used to interacting with 'AI' agents by voice and speech
	- ... and we'll likely do it unknowingly more and more, too

- The idea of an 'always on' AI assistant interacting by voice and speech may not be far off
	- Jarvis (Iron Man) or Jane (Ender's Saga)

- Some devices will abandon conventional interfaces
	- [The Rabbit r1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_r1) is a good (but bad) initial example

---

### ... and you'll understand how it all works!

- (To the extent that we as a species do)

- Future methods will probably be conceptually similar to current neural approaches
	- If not simpler!

- Differences in architecture and process will vary, but statistical learning is statistical learning!
	- ... and current trends are towards "Input -> Magic -> Output"

- Which brings us to an important question!

---

# What have we learned?

---

### We looked at four main questions this quarter

- How do computers turn speech into numbers (and back)?

- How do computers *modify* speech?

- How do computers turn speech into text?

- How do computers turn text into speech?

---

### How do computers turn speech into numbers (and back)?

- How do sound waves become binary strings?

- How do we extract meaningful features (e.g. pitch, formants)?

- How do we turn speech into a matrix of useful numbers?

- How do we turn speech into a *compressed* and more efficient representation?

---

### How do computers modify speech?

- How do we filter a speaker's voice out of noise?

- How do we transmit a voice with encryption/efficiency?

- How do we change the characteristics of a voice (autotune/resynthesis)

---

### How do computers turn those numbers into text?

- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

- Legacy ASR Methods

- Wake Word Detection and other methods for improving ASR in our lives

- Determining the most probable string based on ambiguous words

---

### How do computers turn that text into speech?

- Text-to-Speech (TTS, 'Speech Synthesis')

- Legacy methods like Unit Selection

- Modern Neural Models

- Modifying the 'voice' of TTS models and copying others

---

### We also answered other questions along the way

- How do we store sound on disk?

- How do we collect speech data for building corpora?

- How do cell phones send your voice over a bad connection?

- How do deep neural networks work?

---

### ... and we thought about some of the hard questions

- Where's the right balance between ease of use and privacy?

- What kind of data *should* be used to improve these models?

- When is it acceptable to use these to replace humans?

- What *should* a computer sound like, anyways?

- Is it OK to make these systems sound like a particular person?

---

### And we now understand every element of the spoken interaction pipeline!

<img class='r-stretch' src='diagrams/speech_processing_pipeline.jpg'>

---

### We have covered a ridiculous amount of material this quarter

- WAV FFT DCT LPC MFCC MP3 OPUS LID i-vector DNN CNN ASR TTS Wav2Vec2

- Not to mention the 500,000 various neural architectures we had to breeze by

- I damned near apologize for the amount you all had to learn to do this right

---

### Yet, now you understand a *lot*

- You understand why the Nyquist Theorem is a roadmap to a happy life

- You know how your phone stores or streams that Daft Punk song, how it gets played back, and how it was created

- You understand what's happening when your phone turns your words into text, badly

- You understand why your phone might say /lɪgən/ for LIGN 168, but /əlajn/ for 'align'

- ... and you know how to steal your professor's voice for identity theft reasons
	- Enthusiastic consent is required, thanks.

---

## What did you learn that was particularly interesting to you?

---

### ... but this is LIGN 168

- Not ECE or CS or DSC 168

- So, why do linguists care about this?

---

## What does this teach us about language?

---

### Computational Speech Processing can be a very engineering-y field

- Solving problems people have with computers with computers

- Often, electrical engineers and data scientists and 'AI' people are leading the charge

- For many, it's about language, not Language

	- "Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up" - [Frederick Jelinek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jelinek#cite_ref-6)

- You can do a *lot* of computational speech processing without really understanding speech

---

### ... but we can learn a lot about Speech from the solutions!

- How machines understand speech tells us how humans might understand speech

- TTS systems tell us about what's fixed and varying, and how we train them tells us what 'matters' for perception

- Computational measurement of speech has been instrumental (🤣) in advancing the field of phonetics

- ... but the most important concept of all is...

---

# Framing

---

### Wait, nevermind

---

# Speech doesn't have to be special!

---

### Computers can *do* speech very effectively now

- Our existing algorithms for processing sound are unreasonably effective at working on and improving speech signals

- Current models are *really good* at understanding speech for people well-represented in the training data

- Current models are *really good* at reproducing speech for dialects well-represented in the training data

- We have *really good* engineering solutions to most computational speech problems (for wealthy languages and users)

---

### Yet, these algorithms are not speech specific

- Compression just finds sources and filters, and that's not only an issue of speech

- ASR can just be associating patterns in waves with patterns of letters and sounds

- TTS can be done by creating images of spectrograms based on strings of letters

- The thing that makes speakers different can be 'learned' by statistics in an embedding space

---

## Every speech task we considered appears to be solvable with statistical learning!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/statistical_learning.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/statistical_learning_window.png">

---

### This doesn't mean humans are doing the same thing

- We are better at this than machines, still, so maybe there's more to it than statistics
	- Or we're just deeper neural networks?

- Perhaps we treat speech as *more special* than machines do, and that makes us able to learn faster and more robustly

- Maybe we're doing more symbolic reasoning, a weakness of current DNNs

- Maybe we just know more about the world, so we don't make certain classes of errors

---

### ... but it means the task is doable with just math!

- Human speech doesn't need specific algorithms which include innate linguistic knowledge to be produced and perceived

- Human speech doesn't need reference to phonemes or phonological rules to be produced and perceived

- Human speech doesn't need to be treated any differently than any other waveform to be linked to linguistic representations

- The same models which do vision, sequence understanding, and 'AI', can be applied to solve speech tasks

---

### So, we learn that speech doesn't have to be special to work

- Speech processing doesn't even need to be done by humans to be effective

- Yet...

---

### Studying these systems shows us how special speech is!

- The signal is wildly complicated, needing incredible nuance to capture and measure it well

- We are able to understand speech even when wildly distorted, modified, and resynthesized

- Capturing 'basic' characteristics like speaker identity, emotion, and dialect requires vast complexity

- Only after 70 years of speech research are computers able to approximate human perception and production of speech

---

### ... and it's worth remembering that ...
