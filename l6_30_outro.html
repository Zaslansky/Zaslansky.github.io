<h1>Linguistics 6: Computers and Language</h1>
<h3>Dr. Will Styler - Spring 2022</h3>

---

### Today's Plan

- What we've learned

- The future of Language and Computers

- Your future in NLP
 
---

# What we've learned

---

### We've covered a huge amount of material this quarter

- Machine Learning
- Acoustic and Articulatory Phonetics
- Automatic Speech Recognition
- Text-to-Speech Synthesis
- Unix
- Language Modeling
- Morphosyntax
- POS Tagging and Dependency Parsing
- Lexical Semantics and Word Sense
- Semantic Parsing
- Event Semantics
- Pragmatics
- Conversational Interaction

---

### We started the quarter with an example

---

### "Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"

- "Traffic to work is light, so it should take 10 minutes via Voigt drive"

<img class="r-stretch" src="comp/route_to_work.png">

---

### This is amazing

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/surprisedkoala.jpg">

---

### ... but we now know how it was done!

---

### What did I say?  (Acoustic and Articulatory Phonetics)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

---

### How did she turn that into text?  (Automatic Speech Recognition)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb> 

- What parts of it were most difficult?

---

### What parts of speech are there?

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

---

### How did she figure out what parts of speech were there? (Automatic POS Tagging)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

- How/WRB long/RP to/TO drive/VB to/TO work/NN

---

### What kind of syntactic information did she extract? (Dependency parsing)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/dep_howlongdrive.jpg">

---

### What word senses did she decide on? (Word Sense Disambiguation)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

- drive.v.01 - 'Operate a vehicle'
- workplace.n.01 - 'A place where work is done'

---

### What arguments does that verb expect? (Lexical Semantics)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

- Arg0-PAG: driver (vnrole: 11.5-agent) 
- Arg1-PPT: vehicle or path (vnrole: 11.5-theme)

---

### How do those arguments map onto the sentence? (Shallow Semantic Parsing)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb>

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/dep_howlongdrive_roles.jpg">

---

### What queries do we form from this? (Information Retrieval)

- We need ARGM-TMP of 'drive' when ARGM-GOL == 'work'

- ARG0-PAG == $USER

- $USERLOC == getlocation($DEVICE)

- ARGM-GOL == $WORKLOC == 9500 Gilman Drive 92093

- "Get ($TRAFFICSTATUS,$DRIVETIME,$DRIVEROUTE) for navigate($USERLOC,$WORKLOC,car)"

---

### Response Generation (Language Modeling and Pragmatics and Interaction Design)

- Traffic to $ARGM-GOL is $TRAFFICSTATUS, so it should take $DRIVETIME minutes via $DRIVEROUTE

- > <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb> <clg>"Traffic to work is light, so it should take 10 minutes via Voigt drive"</clg>


---

### Response Playback (Text-to-Speech Synthesis)

> <clb>"Hey Siri, how long to drive to work?"</clb> <clg>"Traffic to work is light, so it should take 10 minutes via Voigt drive"</clg>

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/surprisedkoala.jpg">

---

### This remains an *incredibly* complicated process

- ... but you now understand the concepts underlying most of it

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/areyouawizard.png">

---

### ... and in the process, you've now covered many of the principal subfields in human linguistics

- <img class="r-stretch" src="img/trojanhorse.jpg">

---

### These systems are not perfect, though

- There is much room for improvement

---

# The Future of Virtual Assistants and NLP

---

### Better NLP functionality

- Improved ASR accuracy

- Improved TTS quality

- Better automatic parsing and POS tagging

- Improvements to Lexical Resources

- Richer semantic parses

---

### Greater breadth of language coverage

- Duplication and expansion of existing resources for other world languages

- Attempts at offering such a service to signed language users

- **Improved NLP and Virtual Assistant resources for less wealthy languages**

---

### Reduced 'Brittleness' to variability

- Less of a 'happy path' effect

- Improved ability to handle a greater diversity of phrasings of existing commands

- Improved ability to handle a wider diversity of voices and accents

- Improved ability to cope with subadjacency constructions

- Improved conversational repair

---

### Better reach

- Improved ability to interact with a wider number of systems

- Improved integration with existing systems

- More 'skills' to accomplish more tasks

---
	
### More safeguards
	
- This tech can be very good, but also very bad
	
- We need to worry a bit about how to prevent incomplete AI from hurting people
	
---

---

### Practical Improvements

- Offline functionality for ASR and TTS and basic question-answering

- Enhanced privacy protections, allowing deeper learning with little trouble

- Improvements to wake-word technology allowing even more fluid access and lower idle power consumption

- Increased ubiquity at decreased cost

---


### More senses and sensors

- Ability to refer to visual data

- "What's that over there?"

- Leveraging existing sensor meshes

---

### Aside: This is how humans work

- We are all vats of brain matter sitting in a dark hole surrounded by bone

- We build our understanding from a mesh of sensor data

- The 'real world' is just inference from input data

---

### Deeper Understanding and Better Inference

- Improved personalized knowledge to enhance inference on real-world topics

- Improved discourse context, to allow this to feel more like a 'relationship'

- Improved understanding of the person's actual life

---

### Greater Agency

- "The next bus will arrive at Gilman and Eucalyptus in 10 minutes. I'll text Jessica and tell her you're on your way."

- "It's time to leave for the airport. I've called a Lyft.  Don't forget your passport and glasses, leave your pocketknife at home, and make sure to take your good razor out of your toiletry bag if you're using a carry-on."

- "Hey, it's time to see the Dentist. Dr. Pradhan's got availability next Tuesday at 2pm, and so do you.  Should I confirm?"

- "It's Valentine's Day next week. You should remember to grab a card for Jessica.  Would you like me to order some dark red roses?"

---

### Better Interaction

- Long term knowledge of preferences and desires

- Better knowledge of the people, places, and things in the user's life

- Improved conversational latency

- More natural-feeling conversation

---

### More dynamic conversation

- Once we have the basics down, we can make these conversations more natural

- Changes to dialect, word choice, etc

- More conversational paths and approaches

- Less 'wooden' interactions

---

### Artificial Intelligence

- General Artificial Intelligence may solve many of these problems

	- ... and will certainly improve every aspect of these

- Even an artificial idiot solves many of them

- AI comes with its own difficulties

---

---

... but the simple fact is ...

---

# Computers need to get better at human language

---

### This will require advances in computing

- Improved machine learning

- Improved resource efficiency

- Better Digital Signal Processing

- Better knowledge representations

---

### ... and advances in Linguistics

- Better understanding of speech

- Better language modeling

- Better models of semantics and semantic inference

---

## This is your job, now

---

### You'll need to prepare yourself

---

### Useful Linguistics Courses

- LIGN 101 (Intro to Linguistics)

- LIGN 110 (Articulatory Phonetics)

- LIGN 121 (Syntax)

- LIGN 130 (Semantics)

---

### Useful computational follow-up courses

- LIGN 17 (Making and Breaking Codes)

- LIGN 165 (Computational Linguistics)

- LIGN 167 (Deep Learning for Natural Language Understanding)

- LIGN 168 (Computational Speech Processing)

- ... and lots of grad classes, coming soon!

---

### Also consider the Computational Social Sciences Minor or MS

- Focuses on data-driven problems and work throughout the social sciences

- NLP is a part of it, but there's lots more!

- <https://css.ucsd.edu/>

---

### You have many paths

- Academia and Research

- Government

- Industry

---

### ... but these are exciting times

---

First, we had keyboards

- Then, mice changed everything

- ### Now, we are on the verge of interacting with our computers in the same way we interact with everything else

---

### Oh my!
