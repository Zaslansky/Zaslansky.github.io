# Productivity in Morphology
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### Today's Plan

- The Wide World of Words

- Morphological Productivity

- Productivity as Restriction

- Productivity as Extension

- Lexicalization

---

# The Wide World of Words

---

### Languages have many, *many* words

- The average adult speaker of a language knows 20,000-30,000 words

    - This is surprisingly hard to estimate!

---

### A big part of learning a language is learning the vocabulary!

- These include function words

    - Pre/Postpositions, Determiners, Pronouns, Conjunctions)
    
- As well as content words

    - Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs
    
- These words range from very common ('the') to very uncommon ('decimate')

---

### Zipf's Law

- "In a given corpus of natural language, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table"

- *The most common words are **really** common!*

    - ... and the rarest words are super rare

---

<img class="wide" src="morphology/zipf2.jpg">

---

### This is a double-edged sword

- We don't need to know *that* many words to be functional day-to-day

- **but** rare words are exceedingly rare

---

### We need to be able to interact with and understand unknown words!

- Because we probably don't know all of the words

- ... and even if we did, we need new words regularly!

---

### New words are commonly required

- New concepts are regularly developed

 - New cultural or general concepts need marked

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/binge_watch.jpg">

---

### So, we need some way to be able to use and decipher new words!

---

### We've talked about many *morphological processes*

- Affixation

- Stem modification

- Conversion

- Reduplication

---

### To mark a meaning, the process is applied to a word

- This could be inflectional

    - e.g. kot -> koti ('cat' -> 'cats' in Russian)
    
- Or derivational

    - e.g. 'thick' -> 'thickness'
    
---

### Individual morphological processes don't apply to every word

- Cuteness, but *quicklyness

- English plural as 'cats', 'dogs', 'dishes', 'deer', 'oxen', 'foci'

    - *deers and *cat and *dishi and *dogen (as plural form)

- Speakers know what forms apply to which words
    
---

## This is a glanch

<img class="small" src="img/object.jpg">

- There are two ___?

- An object that is a lot like this would be ___?

- If you turn something into a glanch, you would ___ it?

- Somebody who uses a glanch would be a ____?

---

# Morphological Productivity

---

### Morphological Productivity

- The degree to which a grammatical process is in use by speakers

- Can we use this morphological pattern with a brand new base?

---

### Interesting questions in Productivity

- What knowledge or abilities do speakers/listeners use to make/understand words they haven't heard before?

- How can we characterize the productivity of a morphological process?

- How do we know what processes *can* and *can't* work with a given word?

- Is this word form learned as a monolithic whole, or as analyzable chunks?

---

### How do we describe productivity?

- There are two approaches in common use

- 1) *Assume patterns are general, and then discuss restrictions*

- 2) *Assume patterns are local, and then discuss extensions*

---

# Productivity as Restriction

---

### One approach: Assuming general patterns

- "Let's assume that all morphological patterns are *unconstrained*, and then identify those unique places where it appears *constrained!*"

- Identify the pattern, then describe when that pattern can't be extended to new forms

- The **restrictions** dictate the productivity

---

### English *-ity* makes nouns from adjectives

- Sparse -> Sparsity

- Secure -> Security

- Responsible -> Responsibility

- Productive -> Productivity

---

### English *-ity* doesn't always work

- Foolish -> *Foolishity

- Sexy -> *Sexity

- Peaceful -> *Peacefulity

    - ... but we have 'Foolishness', 'Sexiness', and 'Peacefulness' to carry the day

- **-ity works with all adjectives except those ending in -ish, -y, or -ful**

    - This is its *productivity*

---

## Types of Restrictions on Productivity

---

### There are three kinds of restrictions often found with productivity

- Phonological Restrictions

- Semantic Restrictions

- Morphological Restrictions

---

### Phonological Restrictions

- The *form* of the base restricts the application of an affix

- English patient noun -ee works in retiree and payee

    - ... but not with free -> \*freeee or accompany -> \*accompanyee
    
- English verbal -ize works with **pri**vatize and **glo**balize

    - ... but not with cor**rupt** -> \*cor**ruptize** or se**cure** -> \*se**curize**
    
---

### Phonological Restrictions

- These have no semantic or morphological basis, just simple rules *based on the form of the word!*

- -ee only attaches to words without final /i/

- -ize only attaches when there would be an alternating rhythm

---

### Semantic Restrictions

- The *meaning* of the base restricts the application of an affix

- Russian "quality noun" affix -stvo only works with people-describing adjectives

- bogatyj ‘rich’ -> bogatstvo ‘richness’

- znakomyj ‘acquainted’ -> znakomstvo ‘acquaintance’

- udaloj ‘bold’ -> udal’stvo ‘boldness’

- lukavyj ‘wily’ -> lukavstvo ‘cunning’

- vjalyj ‘withered’ -> *vjal’stvo

- priemlemyj ‘acceptable’ -> *priemlemstvo

---

### Morphological Restrictions

- The *grammatical or morphological nature* of the base restricts the application of an affix

- The English -ee only attaches to verbs

    - Retire -> Retiree, but quickly -> \*quicklyee
    
- The *-ando* progressive aspect in Spanish only attaches to '-ar' verbs

    - caminar -> caminando, but subir -> \*subiando

---

# Productivity as Extension

---

### Alternative Approach: Assuming locality

- "Let's assume that all morphological patterns are *constrained*, and then identify those unique places where it appears *to extend!*"

- Identify the pattern, then describe what forms it extends to.

- The **extent** dictates the productivity

---

### English *-ity* works best with some forms

- "*English -ity is typically used to make nouns from adjectives ending in -able and -ive*"

    - responsible -> responsibility, productive -> productivity, available -> availability, payable -> payability
    
    - creative -> creativity, inclusive -> inclusivity, responsive -> responsivity

- "*Sure, maybe it works with some other words, but that is where it's **always** productive*"

    - sparse -> sparsity, secure -> security, horrible -> ?horriblity
    
---

### There's often ambiguity here

- There isn't always just one form

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### Something that tastes like almonds tastes...

A: Almondy

B: Almondish

C: Almondtacular

D: Almonderiffic

E: of almond


---

### There's also sometimes competition

- Especially when many morphemes are borrowed and the 'proper' form depends on the language

- "Was this borrowed from Latin? Greek? Is this Germanic?"

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### This is an octopus. Now there are two of them.  There are two...

A: Octopus

B: Octopuses

C: Octopi

D: Octopodes

E: Hexadecapus

---

### Productivity is about patterns

- We can ask these same questions for other patterns of morphological change

    - Stem modification, reduplication, and more

- How often does this process occur for new words?

- How regularly (and where) does it occur for existing words?

---

### We're very productive!

- Humans are excellent at finding and extending patterns

- **Let's give it a try**

---

### What do these memes have in common?  Where do they differ?

---

### Many other memes have productive and unproductive domains

# Lexicalization and Fossilized Forms

---

### Sometimes, forms completely cease being productive

- -en is no longer a productive plural for English

    - oxen, children, women, \*wugen, \*thoten

- Ablaut is no longer a productive process

    - sit -> sat, sing -> sang, sting -> stung, ding -> \*dung, yeet -> \*yote
    
---

### A process which is no longer productive has been 'lexicalized'

- We view 'children' as a quirk of 'child'

    - ... not as the expression of a working process
    
- We view 'brethren' as a separate word

    - ... not as the plural of 'brother'
    
- We consider `strong' (ablauted) verbs to be 'irregular'

    - ... rather than another way to make a past tense
    
---

### At this point, the affix is fossilized

- You may find it in old words

- Speakers may be vaguely aware of the affix

- It's no longer active

- It is lost to the language

<audio data-autoplay src="video/lotr_ring.m4a"></audio>

<img class="wide" src="img/onering.jpg">

*... and some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend, legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the morpheme passed out of all knowledge.*

---
<section data-background="img/parchment.jpg">

<img class="wide" src="img/smeagol.jpg">

*Until, when chance came, it ensnared another bearer.*

---

### ... but that's next week!

---

### Wrapping Up

- There are a great many words, but we always need more

- Some affixes are productive, available to use for new words

- We can define productivity in terms of restriction, or extension

- When a form completely ceases to be productive, it is *lexicalized*

- ... until it is discovered once more

---

### For Next Time

- Some fun data, then we'll get creative
