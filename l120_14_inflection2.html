# Inflectional Morphology: Verbs
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### Today's Plan

- Agreement

- Tense

- Aspect

- Mood

---

### Last time, we talked about common inflectional meanings on nouns

- This time, we'll move to verbal meaning

---

### Common Inflectional Patterns on Verbs

- Agreement

- Tense

- Aspect

- Mood

- Other verbal meanings

---

## Agreement

---

## Agreement

Marks the identity of the 'actors' and their roles on the verb itself

- Also known as 'Concord'

- This is helpful for marking grammatical relations!

---

### English agreement marking

- Sharon write-s to me
- sharon write-3SGsubj to 1sg.ACC

---

### Spanish Agreement Marking

* Yo veo el gato
* 1sg see.1sgsubj el cat
* I see the cat

* The arguments aren't marked

* *... but the verb (and ordering) lets us know who did it!*

---

### Spanish Agreement Marking

* Michael Bay hizo peliculas malas
* Michael Bay make.3sgsubj.past movie-pl bad-pl
* "Michael Bay made bad movies"

* *We know that the plural argument did it!*

---

### This is why Spanish can drop many pronouns

- Veo el gato (rather than 'yo veo')

- Tiene una tiza. 'He/she has a chalk'

- ... but in English, \*Has a chalk.

---

### Agreement can use many ways of showing identity

* Person marking (1sg, 2sg, etc)

	* 2sg did it!

* Number marking (singular, plural, etc)

	* The group with more than one item did it!

* Gender marking (masc, fem, neuter)

	* It was the masculine thing!

---

### More ways of showing identity!

* Noun class

	* It was the large, flat object!

* New vs. old information markers

	* The thing I mentioned first did it!
	
---

### "What's the difference between case and agreement?"

---

## Case marks roles on arguments!

---

### Russian Case Marking

- Will vidye-l koshk-u
- Will.NOM see-SG.MASC.PST cat-ACC.FEM
- "Will saw the cat."

---

### With case, you make the arguments wear nametags

* So you know what role the arguments are playing

---
### Will-NOM see-3sg CAT-ACC

---

### Will-NOM see-3sg CAT-ACC

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/myroleisobject.jpg"> 

---

## Agreement marks identity on verbs!

* "Rather than marking the arguments, let's just make sure the verb points to who did it!"

---

---

### Let's test your skills!

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>
squirrele eta acornu

squirrel.NOM eat acorn.ACC

"The Squirrel ate the Acorn"

A) "This is case"

B) "This is agreement"

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>
kula-knas Michael Bay Will 

judge-object.is.evil Michael Bay Will 

"Will judges Michael Bay"

A) "This is case"

B) "This is agreement"

---

## So, are we all in...

# Agreement!?

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">

---

(OK, Sorry, but a bit of humor is helpful before things get tense)

---

## Tense

---

## Tense

Represents the relationship of the event described to another temporal reference point

---

### Generally, the reference time is 'now'

- ... but there is such a thing as narrative present

---

### The Timeline

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/tense_reftime.jpg">

---

### A three-way tense system

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/tense_3waytense.jpg">

---

### Two-way tense systems

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/tense_nonfuture.jpg">

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/tense_nonpast.jpg">

---

### A non-present tense system

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/tense_nonpresent.jpg">

---

### Tense can get more detailed

- Tenses for yesterday, tomorrow

- Tenses for next year, last year

- Tenses for smaller within-day periods

- **... but tense always marks time of action relative to a reference!**

---

... which is different from ...

---

## Aspect

---

## Aspect

Aspect marks the temporal nature and boundedness of described events.

---

### Aspect is widely variable

- There are many different types of aspect which can be marked

- Aspects are often coupled with tense, but don't need to be!

- *Tense and aspect are not the same thing!*

---

---

### These aren't all the possible aspects

- Sometimes, aspect is marked on verbs
  
    - Spanish preterite vs. imperfective

- Sometimes, different verbs have inherent aspect

    - Russian verbs of aspect

- Sometimes, other verbs are used

    - 'I'll start eating tomorrow'

- They're all gonna have this same feeling of describing the temporal boundedness and structure of an event

---

## Mood (also known as 'mode' or 'modality')

---

## Mood

Grammatical functions which encode the speaker's attitude about the event being described

- This is independent of tense and aspect

---

### Many modes exist!

- We'll talk about some common modes

---

### Realis vs. Irrealis

- "Is it actually happening, or not?"

- "I went to the park" vs. "Had I gone to the park..."

- Indicative is the only realis mood in most languages

---

### Indicative

- Used for factual statements

- This is the default

- "Will is flailing his arms around"

---

### Subjunctive

- Used for imaginary or hypothetical events

- "If a pizza were to appear, I would ensure that it <clr>be</clr> eaten"

- Maria comería si <clr>tuviera</clr> hambre. 'Maria would eat if she <clr>were hungry</clr>'

---

### Conditional

- This event depends on some other situation being true

- "I <clr>would go</clr> to the party, if I were invited"

- Maria <clr>comería</clr> si tuviera hambre. 'Maria <clr>would eat</clr> if she were hungry'

---

### Potential

- Something that's more likely than subjunctive or conditional

- "This is probably going to happen"

- *Mood is about speaker attitude*

- **Epistemic** is even weaker, 'this is actually possible.'

---

### Inferential

- Reports events without confirming them

- "Andres was at the park."

    - "I saw him there myself"
    
    - "Amber said he was there"
   
- Turkish o gitti vs. o gitmiş

---

### Imperative

- Imperatives issue commands, make requests, and give prohibitions

- "<clr>Turn off</clr> that Michael Bay movie."

- "<clr>Do not open</clr> Pandora's Box"

- **Jussive** issues commands to a third person, or generally

    - "Michael Bay movies are not to be watched"

---

### Deontic

- Expresses the speaker's belief that X *should* occur

    - In the sense of 'it would be better'
    
- "Will should stop eating donuts"

---

### Other Moods

- **Optative** - Marks hopes, requests and wishes

- **Interrogative** - Marks asking a question explicitly

- ... and plenty more!

---

## Other Verbal Markings

---

### Some arguments change the number of participants in a verb's frame

- Active vs. Passive voice

    - "I stole the donut" vs. "The donut was stolen"
    
- Reflexive markers

    - Marks that the subject and the object are the same

    - "I bathed myself"

- Causative markers

    - "I didn't do it, but I made somebody else do it"

- Reciprocal markers

    - "We sunblocked each other"

- Transitivizing markers

    - Makes an intransitive verb transitive

---

### Other residents of the verb

- Negation markers

- Directional markers

    - "I ran uphill"
    
- Pronouns

    - da-me el reloj! (give.2SG.IMP-1SG.DAT DET clock)
    
- Noun incorporation

    - Who needs multiple words, just toss the object right in there!

---

### Wrapping Up

- Verbs take lots of morphology

- Agreement shows connections between the verb and the arguments

- Tense shows the temporal position of events

- Aspect talks about their temporal structure and boundaries

- Mood gives the speaker's attitude about them

- There's more to verbal morphology

    - ... but you'll find it when you start working with your own languages!

---

## For Next Time

- How do we elicit these contrasts?

- Then, derivation!
