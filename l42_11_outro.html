---

### Participation grades will go up shortly

- All other grades will be finalized soon

---

## What have we learned?

---

### It's always helpful to look back as a way of summarizing a long quarter's worth of work

- To contemplate just how far we've come

---

### What have we learned about memes?

---

### What have we learned about the internet?

---

### What have we learned about language and linguistic analysis?

---

### What's the most important thing you learned?

---

## What does the future hold?

---

### How do you think memes will change in the future?

- Formats?

- Topics? 

- Morphology?

	- (Unlike Will's memes)

---

## A Final Thank you

---

### This class and group has been the best I could've hoped for this new format

- You've been kind to each other and to me

- You've worked together, and found common ground with relative ease

- You've engaged with the questions, and made this class more than just a meme

---

### I've learned an incredible amount from you all!

- You've helped me better understand how a shifting medium has shifted

- You've helped me to confirm many ideas I had about the linguistics of memes

- You've shared elements of the meme world that I never, ever would've found on my own

- I can now have a bias in Floptropica while watching Sylvanian Drama and maining Articuno ðŸ—¿

- I will never be able to say "That's a thing" without laughing internally

---

### You've also challenged me

- You've highlighted places where my understanding is not accurate (anymore?)

- Teaching this material has forced me to grow and innovate as a teacher

- You've made me expand my cultural and memetic sphere of understanding

- I aged more on Wednesday than I had in every year prior

---

### You have forever shaped this course

- I appreciate you all, and will likely always appreciate you all, whenever I teach this course

- I will be thrilled if my next group of students is as kind, fun, participatory, and excellent as you all are

- I've learned a great deal, and the next course will be better for your having blazed the trail

---

### I hope you've learned from me too

- That some of this will be helpful as you move forward in your life as an online person, a memer, and a language user

- I hope that you now understand language better, and will see these facts on both sides of the digital divide

- I hope that you've now seen just how weird a college class can be while still talking about important and interesting ideas

- ... and if there's one important thing I want you all to take away from this quarter...
