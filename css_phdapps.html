---

### Today's Plan

- What is a Ph.D?

- Pros and Cons of getting a Ph.D

- What to look for in Ph.D programs?

- What do applications look like?

- Where might a Ph.D lead?

---

### Important Proviso

- Your field might be a bit different!

- Chat with faculty in your area

---

## What is a Ph.D?

---

### General Structure of a Ph.D

- Years 1-2
	- Course work, TAing, Independent Research

- Years 3-5
	- Extra course work, continue TAing
	- Come up with dissertation (Ph.D. thesis) topic → “qualify”
	- Write dissertation, apply for jobs
	- Finish the Dissertation and leave!

---

### A Ph.D is your chance to dive *deep* into a field of your choosing

- You will take classes in your field

- You'll likely teach and help with other people's research

- You'll do your own research

- You'll mentor undergraduates and M.S. students

- You'll write a dissertation, and likely other smaller papers

---

### Mentorship

- You'll work with a specific advisor, who will guide you through the process
	- Some people are co-advised, this is common for interdisciplinary folks

- This person will help guide your dissertating, your coursework, and train you on how to be a good academic and scholar

- They should be your strongest advocate in the department

- Some advisors are more 'lab' focused, where the PI works with senior students, senior students help junior students, junior students help undergrads...
	- You should always be able to make an appointment with your mentor

---

### The Dissertation

- A large research project where you need to advance the knowledge of the field (just a little!)

- Should show independent research into something which is new for our species

- Mine was ['On the Acoustical and Perceptual Features of Vowel Nasality'](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/publications.html)

- You will never get another chance to nerd as singlemindedly on something as this

---


## Pros and Cons of a Ph.D

---

### Pros of a Ph.D

- Ability to dive deeper than any class allows in a particular field

- Opportunities to teach and do research in your field

- Classes which are as advanced as one can find

- Strong 1-on-1 mentorship from an expert in the field

- Opportunity and support to focus in on one topic for a massive research project

---

### Cons of a Ph.D

- 5-7 years of fiscal renunciation 

- Inability to 'put down roots' for 5-7 years

- Lots of hard work, with long hours

- If you don't love it going in, you'll hate it coming out

- The return on your investment involves a probability distribution of unknown nature

---

### "You get a Ph.D in social science only if there's *nothing else* you can imagine doing with your life"

- "I have questions I can't NOT answer"

- "My only path to happiness requires a Ph.D"

- "No other plan for the next 5-7 years makes sense to me"

- "Teaching this at the college level is my only path to joy"

- "I really don't want to be on the job market right now..."

---

### This doesn't mean it's a bad choice, just that it shouldn't be an easy choice

- "That just seems like the natural next step" is not a good enough answer!

- Consider this carefully!

### Other thoughts?

---

## What to look for in Ph.D Programs

---

### Apply to advisors, not programs!

- If you keep citing them, think about working with them!
	- Or maybe their students...

- Find the people you respect in the field, and apply to work with them

- Reach out to potential advisors ahead of time

- The most prestigious program is not always the best one for you
	- ... but some fields are more prestige-focused

- Keep an open mind, though!

---

### Do your research!

- Read the graduate handbook for programs you're considering

	- Seriously, it's incredibly helpful to see what policies exist

- Contact current students under your prospective advisor

	- How do they feel about the program? Their advisor?

- Ask your current professors what they know about the program?

- Talk to your potential mentors and ask how they work with their students

---

### Green flags for Ph.D Programs

- Good student support systems

- Reasonable time to degree

- Strong endorsements from existing students

- Livable wages and student housing

- Opportunities for teaching

---

### Green flags for Ph.D Programs (cont.)

- Students have some voice in the department and campus

- Support for (e.g.) your first and last year without teaching

- Research independence, but with strong support

- Faculty who care about you as humans

---

### Yellow flags for Ph.D programs

- Strong compartmentalization under labs and PIs
	- This can be OK, but also be very isolating

- No/Low housing availability
	- This can be fine in low cost-of-living areas

- Theoretical Hyperfocus
	- A department which does one approach will make you good at that, and weak elsewhere

- 'Superstar' Faculty members or programs
	- You can be a luminary scholar and a terrible mentor, so check!
	- Prominent programs can get toxic, very quickly

- More than 5 year time to degree

---

### Red flags for Ph.D programs

- One person has complete power over your ability to progress
	- With no external checks and balances

- (Potential) advisors have little time for you

- Non-liveable wages for the area

- High rates of students leaving the program
	- ... or transferring away from a certain advisor

- Policies which systematically disadvantage students
	- 'Weeding out' students
	- Also look out for 'hazing' style, 'it was hard for me, and it'll be hard for you' policies

---

### You should never pay for a Ph.D program in the US or Canada!

- There may be some fees, books, and you'll often have to cover living expenses

- You should be paid by the school for your tuition, or at the very least, not pay the school
	- This will often involve a labor component (e.g. RA or TA positions)
	- Sometimes it'll just be free money (e.g. stipends or fellowships)

- **Do not even contemplate a Ph.D Offer in the US or Canada that requires you to pay your own tuition**

## Ph.D Program Applications

---

### Timing

 - Ph.D Applications for (e.g.) Fall 2026 will be submitted in Nov/Dec 2025, with decisions in Feb/March 2026.

- Usually earlier than M.S Applications

---

### Elements of an Application

- Transcripts (from UG and M.S.)

- GRE scores (now likely to be optional)

- Statement of Purpose (not a personal statement!)

- Letters of recommendation (usually 3)

- Original writing sample (may be optional, but recommended)

---

### Statement of Purpose

- Personal reasons for applying, briefly

- Your academic interests for applying: “I am interested in studying speech science, in particular …”
	- Focus on the research questions more than the subdiscipline of interest

- What in your academic or career background has prepared you for grad school and for your research?

- Why you are applying to the specific school and/or advisor?
	- Mention a possible advisor, but also mention other faculty who are interesting (but not all of them)

---

### Demonstrating you have cool questions matters more than your questions!

- You are not committing to study the thing in your personal statement

- I want to see that you can have interesting questions, not commit to one particular one

- Your questions should be realistic, answerable within a Ph.D

- **Your goal is to show me that your head contains interesting questions!**

---

### Letters of Recommendation

- Generally 3, sometimes more or less

- Find people who know you well

- Capstone mentors or professors you interacted with a lot

- Somebody who knows you is better than somebody who is prominent and doesn't know you

---

### Writing Sample

- Should show how you think and write

- Doesn't need to be related to your prospective field

- Capstone projects are OK, but make clear what your role was

- Final projects from project-based classes

---

### Acceptance choices often aren't about you

- Is your desired advisor taking on students this year?

- Does the department only have funding to take on N students, with N+20 great applicants?

- Does the department's allocation of students *have to* go in a certain direction?

- Does the department no longer have the resources to support your specific work?

- Does one grumpy admissions committee member not like your particular research idea?

---

### Other thoughts?

---

## Where does a Ph.D lead?

---

### Post Doctoral Fellowships

- Research based or teaching based

- Independent, or mentored

- Sometimes project-based, sometimes more general purpose

---

### The Academic Job Market

- Very, very rough

- Even assuming nothing changes, it is not easy to get a tenure track job

- 1 position, 100+ applicants, 15 longlist interviews, 4-6 shortlist interviews, 1 chosen candidate

- Often a question of outlasting your competition on the market

- Emotionally draining, and requires mobility and flexibility
	- For both you and the people you love

---

### Ph.Ds in Industry

- In some industry roles, Ph.Ds are required

- In some industry roles, Ph.Ds start you higher up the chain

- In some industry roles, Ph.Ds aren't valued at all

- **LinkedIn is a great way to research this!**

---

### Research-Focused Positions

- Some private organizations employ Ph.Ds for research (only)

- These positions are rare, but can be relatively cushy

- This is one outcome which involves no classroom work

- There may be non-Ph.D paths into similar positions
