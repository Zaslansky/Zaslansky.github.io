# Sociolinguistic Fundamentals
### Will Styler - LIGN 42

---

### Sociolinguistics is the study of the intersection of language and social factors

- Linguists often think of simplified speakers ('Just an American English Speaker')

- We think in terms of 'what's true about language for everybody 'who speaks the language' we're studying?'

- Sociolinguistics brings people back into things, taking everything that sociology does, intersected with everything that linguistics does

---

### Sociolinguistics is a huge field

- We could spend a whole quarter on the sociolinguistics of memes

- We'll just focus on some core concepts

---

### Please be kind

- Social identity is often a very sensitive topic

- You don't need to share anything you'd rather not (remember, we're Podcasting)

- Let's avoid stereotypes, and speak to our own identities where we have more nuance

---

### Today's Plan

- Speech Communities and Social Networks

- Sociolinguistic Variation

- Indexicality and Identity

- Intersectionality

---

## Speech Communities

---

### Language is a social construct

- Different groups of people language differently, in agreed-upon ways

- We call these different groups 'speech communities'

---

### Example Speech Communities

- Social Groups
	- People who hang out together regularly
	
- Geographical Groups
	- People from Chula Vista
	
- Identity-based groups
	- Folks who identify as pansexual
	
- Interest-based groups
	- Folks who love mechanical watches
	
- Clubs and other socially-affiliated people
	- People who attend meetings together on a weekly basis

---

### What are some examples of speech communities that you're a part of?

- Remember, you're likely a part of many!

---

### Sociolinguists also think about these groups in terms of prestige

- Some groups are more respected by society than others

- What's a speech community, which, rightly or wrongly, is given prestige in the US?

- What's a speech community, which, rightly or wrongly, is of lower prestige in the US?

---

### Prestigious isn't always the 'right' choice

- What's a context in which a 'prestige' dialect would be awkward?

- This relates closely to 'register', with high registers often incorporating elements of prestigious language

- We *manage* our prestige, by varying our language

	- Variation is everywhere!

---

## Sociolinguistic Variation

---

### Language features differ among people

- Sometimes it's truly random

- Sometimes, it's based on language use (e.g. how often you say things)

- Often, it's *socially conditioned*

- We call individual variations which are socially conditioned and informative **sociolinguistic variables**

---

### Any language variation can be sociolinguistically informative	

- Changes in spelling or emoji use

- Changes in pronunciation or rules governing sound patterns

- Changes in words which are used

- Changes in sentence structure or grammatical differences

- Changes in meaning of words or sentences

- **Any language difference can be a sociolinguistic variable as long as it's socially conditioned!**

---

### Different people language differently

- Give me a language difference which *gives you no social information* about the speaker

- Give me a language difference which *gives you some social information* about the speaker

- Give me a language difference which *gives you excellent and reliable social information* about the speaker

---

### Our language use varies in *context*

- Give me two social contexts *with the same level or formality* in which you speak differently.  How so? 

- Give me a word which is *which is only used in one social context in your life*, and the context

---

### Sociolinguistic Variation tells us about a person's social identities

- We learn social things by observing sociolinguistic variables

- **What kinds of social things can we tell from somebody's language?**

---

## Indexicality and Identity

---

### We exist at the intersection of many social identities

- Gender, Sexuality, Ethnicity, Age, Region, Hobbies, Fandoms, Communities, Beliefs, and more

- These can be facts about you, communities one belongs to, and more

- All of those elements of your identity contribute to how we act and function and live in the world

- We may not be *outwardly expressing* all of these identities at any given moment or context, but they're always a part of us

---

### Social identities place us within speech communities

- Speech communities have clusters of *sociolinguistic features* which are indicative of that community

- They can also be more or less 'obvious' or detectable by listeners
	
	- Some are only obvious to people in that group

- Our sociolinguistic features *tell the world* about our identity

---

### Indexing Identities

- Once folks know that a feature indicates an identity, those features can be said to **index** that particular identity

- Indexing is, effectively, showing or highlighting our identities for others

- Indexing our identities using sociolinguistic features can be intentional (performative), or unintentional

---

### Why would we want to index our identities consciously?

---

### Our language can index our identities, consciously or unconsciously

- What variables, if any, do you *consciously use to index one of your identities*?
	- How do you speak to *show others you belong* or *show your identity to a stranger*?

- Can you think of something you've said which expressed one of your identities *without you intending to do so*?
	- What did somebody pick up on, without your intention to do so?

- This can be *strategic as well*
	- See [Wright 2023 on Linguistic Profiling](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/900094) for a nice example of why that can be useful

---

### What are other sociolinguistic variables that you look for in others to find folks similar to you?

---

## Intersectionality

---

### Intersectionality was formalized in the early 1990s

- Although referenced by W.E.B Du Bois and others earlier, first introduced by KimberleÃÅ Crenshaw

---

### Intersectionality

- We all have many identities

- Those identities all affect our language, social approaches, etc

- **Those identities all interact!**

---

### Simple links

---

### Interactions!

---

### Our identities and their expressions are *intersectional*

- Each person is complex, and likely has many different identities

	- These identities may also have different levels of privilege and power

- Our identities are not isolated, instead, they mix and interact

	- Your features for 'nerdy' might be different from mine because of your other identities
	
- Two people may 'share an identity', but have different experiences with it

	- For one, it may be a core part of their identity, for another, it may be less important or an afterthought

- **Failure to account for intersectionality causes major analytical problems!**

---

### Treating a single identity as homogenous makes you do dumb things

- You're unlikely to find one set of features for one identity consistent across all speakers

	- ... and it'll be noisy even if you try!

- The linguistic expression of identifying as a woman may be different for white, black, latine, and trans women
	
	- Consider interactions between identities when exploring these variables
	
- Some elements of identity can be more or less independent

	- The interaction between identities can be weaker or stronger
	
---

### Treating a person's identity as simple and all-important also causes dumbth

- Collapsing the complexity of individuals' identities into single 'groups' often leads to stereotyping and poorly fitting models

	- 'All black people say...'
	
	- 'You're Bi, so you must...'
		
- Identities can (outwardly) appear to apply, but matter less to the individual

	- Not all X people identify strongly as X
	
	- Not all people from the South speak Southern English

	- [Paul Reed](http://paulereed.com/) has shown that a person's 'Rootedness' to a region is a better predictor of linguistic variables than location or place of birth

---

### All aspects of your identity are reflected in your 'positionality'

- Your positionality refers to the unique combination of identities, experiences, values, opinions, and perspectives that you have.

- It's also worth considering areas where you have social power, and areas where you experience social oppression

- This highlights the fact that the same situation, statement, or question will be seen and addressed differently by folks with different positionalities

- Your positionality will strongly influence your interactions, language use, and sociolinguistic features

---

### We now have a vocabulary for thinking about social variation in language

- **Speech Communities** are groups of people who language similarly

- **Sociolinguistic variables** are socially meaningful variations in language usage

- Our **social identities** are **indexed** by our specific patterns of language use

- Our social identities are **intersectional**, and thus, the patterns of variation associated with those identities are complex

- These intersecting identities and associated experiences form our **positionality**, which we should contemplate as we think about our language use

---

### How does this play out online?

---

### There's a *lot* to be done here

- Internet sociolinguistics could be a three quarter sequence

- Sociolinguistic meme projects are very, very welcome

- We're just barely scratching the surface here!
