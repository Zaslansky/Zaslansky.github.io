# Morphology
### LIGN 42 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- What is morphology?

- How can we identify the components of a word?

- What kinds of morphology exist?

- How does this apply to memes?

---

### Morphology is a major subfield of Linguistics

- ... and is probably the one most applicable to meme analysis

---

### Morphologists ask lots of questions

- What is a word?

	- ... and is this the same everywhere on Earth?

- What components make up words?

	- What are the best strategies for finding the relationship between a wordâ€™s form and its meaning?

- How are new words formed?

	- ... and how do we figure out their meanings?

- How are words stored in the mind?

---

### Let's start with a simple question

- How many parts does the word 'recreated' have?

- How do we know?

---

### We find out about word subparts through finding form/meaning relationships

- Let's explore that idea

---

### Word Set 1

cat, feline, lion, leopard, kitty, pspspspspsps, paw, neko

- **These are related only in meaning**

	- They don't tell us anything about the composition of words

---

### Word Set 2

cat, scatter, catastrophic, scathing, uncategorizable, catcher, catholic

- **These are related only in form**

	- They don't tell us anything about the composition of words
	
---

### Word Set 3

cat, kittycat, catty, catlike, cathouse, cat-and-mouse game, cattery, catio, catnap

- **These are related both in form, and in meaning!**

	- All contain the form 'cat', and all involve ðŸ˜º
		
---

### When form is related, *and* meaning is related, then we've found a chunk!

- 'cat' is a *meaningful chunk* of a word

- We use the term 'morpheme' to mean the smallest meaningful chunk which can be or be part of a word

- Some words have one morpheme ('cat'), and some have many ('unrecognizable')

---

### Word Set 4

start, stop, restart, past, lapsed, static, steady, still

- **These have similar meanings, and all have /st/**

	- Is this a morpheme?
	
	- Why not?

---

## Identifying Morphemes

---

### How can we tell 'Will' from his clothing and accessories?

- Why do you say I'm wearing gray pants, rather than them being a part of me?

- Is my watch a part of Will?

- How can you tell his wedding ring isn't just Will?

- How can you tell his torso **is** an inherent part of Will?

---

### How can we tell the morphemes in 'unrestartable'?

---

### We need evidence that a piece can be re-used elsewhere for it to be a morpheme!

- You can use the plural -s or -ly or cat in a bunch of different words, including ones you've never heard before

	- **Make up a new word using 'cat'**
	
- You can't use 'st' in a new context and preserve the 'temporal boundary' meaning

	- **Go ahead, make my day**

---

### What are the steps to this analysis?

- Group the data by shared elements of meaning

- Within those groups, look for recurring patterns of form

- Build hypotheses, then use them to make guesses about other bits of the data
	- "This also has the morpheme. Does it also mean X?"

- Try to break your analysis with other forms from the language
	- "What words, if any, *don't* follow this pattern?"

---

<table><thead><tr><th>Finnish</th><th>English Gloss</th><th>Finnish</th><th>English Gloss</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>laulan</td><td>'I sing'</td><td>yuon</td><td>'I drink'</td></tr><tr><td>laulat</td><td>'You sing'</td><td>yuot</td><td>'You drink'</td></tr><tr><td>laulavi</td><td>'He sings'</td><td>yuovi</td><td>'He drinks'</td></tr><tr><td>laulamme</td><td>'We sing'</td><td>yuomme</td><td>'We drink'</td></tr><tr><td>laulatte</td><td>'You all sing'</td><td>yuotte</td><td>'You all drink'</td></tr><tr><td>laulavat</td><td>'They sing'</td><td>yuovat</td><td>'They drink'</td></tr></tbody></table>

---

<!--

### A few pitfalls

- Don't assume that every English word/morpheme will be reflected in the other language (or vice versa)

	- English 'I will go' vs. Spanish 'IrÃ©'

- Don't assume that everything which your language marks with a form will be marked in the other language

	- Russian marks gender of the subject on the past tense verb, English doesn't

- Don't assume that there will always be easily identifiable chunks of form for each meaning

	- Which part of the word 'bachelor' carries the meaning 'single'?

-->

### Meaning changes often come from adding new chunks of form

- This is called **'concatenative morphology'**

	- You're adding onto what already exists
	
- Things which get 'stuck on' to base words are called 'affixes'

	- Prefixes and Suffixes are both common in English
	
- cat, kittycat, catty, catlike, cathouse, cat-and-mouse game, cattery, catio, catnap

---

### Not all morphology adds more chunks of form

- Sometimes, *changes to what's already there* mark the difference

	- Remember the changing tones changing meaning in OtomÃ­?

	- Also think about 'run' vs. 'ran', 'sing' vs. 'sung'

	- 'record a song' and 'make a record'

- This is referred to as [**non-concatenative morphology**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonconcatenative_morphology)

---

### Morphology helps us understand the components of words

- ... and how we can figure out the meaning of a new word we've not heard before

---

### OK Will, we get it, morphology is a thing

- ## Why do we care in LIGN 42?

---

### This works for memes too!

- If you can change just one component of a meme and modify the meaning, you know something about the meaning of the components

- Memes have morphemes!

	- Morphmemes?

---

### For each example, let's ask:

- What changed about the form?

	- Was it concatenative or non-concatenative?

- What changed about the meaning?

(Thanks, Yuri)

### ... and by the way

---

### Think of other elements of style

- What does a given audio add to a TikTok?

- Why does cat color matter in a cat meme?

- Why add a particular song to a video?

---


### Morphology works for memes!

- ... and you'll spend the weekend feeling out just how that works

# Important Terms

---

**Morphology**: The study of words, word formation, and word storage, among other elements of linguistics

---

**Morpheme**: The smallest contrastive unit of meaning in a language, or, put differently, the smallest analyzable and usable unit of form and meaning.

---

**Concatenative Morphology**: Adding or changing meaning by adding or removing additional chunks of linguistic forms (e.g. prefixes, suffixes)

- 'throw' -> 'thrown' or 'throwing'

---

**Non-Concatenative Morphology**: Adding or changing meaning by modifying the existing form of the word

- 'yeet' -> 'yote', 'ring' -> 'rang', 'record a record'

---

### Extra Note!

- Sets of words like  'glimmer', 'glitter', 'gleam', 'glamorous', 'glowing', 'glance' which share form and meaning, but no morphemes are often called [phonaesthemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonestheme)

- This is awesome!
