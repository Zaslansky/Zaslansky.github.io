### Today's plan:

- What do vowels sound like?

- Source-Filter Theory

- What do consonants sound like?


---

# Fundamentals of Speech

---

### Voicing

<img width="70%" src="phonmedia/noisebbspectrogram.jpg">

<audio controls src="phonmedia/noise.wav"></audio>

---

### Spectrograms show us many evenly-spaced vertical lines

- These are individual glottal pulses

- Higher pitched voices will have...?

	- More tightly spaced lines!
	
---

### Duration

/bi/, /bid/, /bit/

---

# Vowels

---


### What is a vowel?

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue.png"> 

---

### What is a vowel?

A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

* Different resonances *filter* the sound differently and determine the vowel quality

* **Different tongue shapes create different resonances, and different vowels!**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue2.png"> 

---

### What do vowels sound like?

* We talk about vowel quality in terms of "formants"

* These are bands of the spectrum where the energy is strongest

* The frequencies of these formants are our primary cues to vowels

### If the position of the tongue causes formants to appear...

- What happens in diphthongs, where the tongue moves?

---

### So, we think about vowels in terms of formants

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/vowelformants.gif">

<small>Different American English vowels, as spoken by a male speaker</small>  

---

### ... but what are formants, really?

---

## Source-Filter Theory

---

### The Source-Filter Dichotomy is a 'threshold concept' in Acoustic Phonetics

- Important for understanding speech production and perception

- Key to being able to discuss vowel formants

- Useful for understanding many elements of speech processing

---

### The frequency of Vowel formants is main cue for perceiving vowels in English

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/vowelformants.gif">

- ... and they're helpful for perceiving consonants too!

---

### Formants alone can be enough for some perception!

---

### Let's listen to some sounds

<audio controls>
<source src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingf3.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

<audio controls>

### Now let's play all three at once!

<audio controls>
<source src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingsine.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>

### Does this help?

<audio controls>
<source src="phonmedia/thanksforattendingorig.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
</audio>


---

### But what *are* they, really?

---

### Let's talk about the vocal tract

<img width="20%" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection_source.png"><img width="20%" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection_filter.png">


'Source' and 'Filter'

---

### Source (The Vocal Folds)

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection_source.png">

---

### Source (The Vocal Folds)

<img width="40%" src="phonmedia/larynx_glottis.jpg">

- The vocal folds produce signal with a given **fundamental frequency (f0)** and evenly spaced harmonics.

---

### This source signal is not so pretty

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voicing_filtered_fft.png">

<audio controls>
  <source src="phonmedia/voicing.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>


---

### This source signal is not so pretty

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voicing_filtered_spectrogram.png">

<audio controls>
  <source src="phonmedia/voicing.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

---

### This signal carries pitch information, but not much else

- Everything else happens in the...

---

### Filter (The Vocal Tract)

<img width="20%" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection_filter.png">

- Filters that ugly signal by changing the position of articulators

- What do I mean by filter?

---

### Resonance

<img width="20%" src="phonmedia/resonance_tubes.png">

- Some wavelengths 'fit' well within a cavity of a given size or shape

- Sound at those wavelengths will grow stronger because they 'resonate'

- Sound at other wavelengths will grow quieter and are 'damped'

---

### We all understand resonance

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/bathtub.png">

---

### Resonant Cavities act like filters

- Some spectral regions are made stronger ('poles' or 'formants')

- Some spectral regions are made weaker (by 'zeroes' or 'antiformants')

- Some pass through (relatively) unaffected

- ... and this is how vowels work

---

### The vocal tract filters the source

- Changing the position of the articulators affects the size and shape of the cavity

- *Changing the position of articulators in your vocal tract affects resonances*

---

### We take something boring

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voicing_filtered_spectrogram.png">

(The source signal)


---

### ... and filter it into something beautiful

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisebbspectrogram.png">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/magic.jpg">

---

### Different vowels are just different cavity shapes

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue2.png">

---

### Each cavity shape produces different resonances

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/vowelformants.gif">

---

### Changes in tongue position mean changes in formant structure

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/vowelformantsarticulation.png">

---

### A (creepy) demonstration

<video controls src="video/motormouth.mp4"></video>

---

### So, we have a source, and a filter

- The larynx produces a signal with lots of harmonics

- The rest of the vocal tract filters it into something we recognize as "speech"

---

### Perceiving vowels using formants

- Vowel perception is formant based

	- Although duration, nasality, and other features can play a role!
	
- Formants give us information about what the tongue is doing *even when no closures are being made*

- Formants tell me what your tongue is doing in the mouth!

---

### Measuring vowels using formants

- Studying vowel quality is usually done using formants

	- Although Ultrasound and MRI are possible too
	
- Formants tell me what your tongue is doing in the mouth

	- So changes in formants map to changes in articulation
	
---

## But *where are they?!*

---

### Harmonics are not formants!

- "The vocal folds produce harmonics"

- "Resonance changes harmonics, does it create separate formants?"

- **"Where can I see the formants in a spectral slice?"**

---

### Formants are obvious when you're looking at sounds from a distance

- They show up better when you're not as sharply focused on frequency

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisebbspectrogram.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisefft.jpg">

- **"Where'd the formants go?!"**

---

### A more grounded example

<img src="phonmedia/topo_no_axes.png">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/topo_map.png">

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/topo_labeled.png">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/topo_ranges.png">

---

### Formants are the ranges, not the mountains!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ispectrum.png">

---

### Formants are the areas of the spectrum where harmonics resonate

- Where harmonics of the source are amplified, rather than damped

- This indicates certain positions for the tongue in the mouth
	
	- ... and that's what we're listening for when identifying vowels and consonants

---

One final, crucial point...

---

## Source and Filter are Independent

---

### The Filter will filter any source signal

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/source_filter_independence.png">

### Changing Pitch doesn't change the resonances

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sourcefilter_changepitch_broad.png">

<audio controls>
  <source src="phonmedia/sourcefilter_changepitch.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

---

### Changing resonances doesn't change pitch

<audio controls>

---

### Voice pitch is unrelated to resonance.

- **Resonance is unrelated to voice pitch.**

---

### In fact, there are lots of sources possible

- ... which is good news for people who no longer have a larynx

---

### The Source and the Filter are Independent

---

### Interim Summary

- The vocal folds provide a source signal for speech

- The rest of the vocal tract filters that source into identifiable sounds

- We call those ranges of harmonics that resonate with a certain articulation "Formants"

- These resonances tell us how the vocal tract is being shaped at that moment

- Formants are crucial for percieving (and measuring) vowels

- **The Source and the Filter are independent**

---

### Vowel formants are reflections of articulations

- They vary depending on the tongue's position

	- ... as well as the size and shape of the talker's head

- *Different formants from the same speaker mean different vowels*

	- ... kind of

## **Vowel perception is really, really hard**

- ... so, consonants must be easy, right?

# Consonant Acoustics

---

### /l r w j/ act a lot like vowels

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sonorant_acoustics.jpg">

---

### Nasals look like quiet vowels

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/nasalcons_acoustics.jpg">

---

### Fricatives have little black clouds

- ... and the cloud is higher frequency as you get closer to the mouth

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/fricative_acoustics.jpg">

---

### Voiced fricatives have little clouds *and* voicing

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/fricative_voiced_acoustics.jpg">

---

### For stops, the signal... stops (with voicing)

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/stop_voiced_acoustics.jpg">

---

### For stops, the signal... stops (without voicing)

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/stop_voiceless_acoustics.jpg">

---

### Taps are really tricky to spot

### If you want more of this...

- We have a spectrogram reading group! 

- [Rob Hagiwara's Monthly Mystery Spectrogram Webzone](http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~robh/index.html)

	- They're *really* difficult

---

### Speech Acoustics is the basis of automatic speech recognition

- If we don't know what words sound like, we can't teach computers what they sound like

- Spectrograms give us great information about frequency, power, and time

- Similar patterns are easy to confuse for humans and computers

- This lets us understand a bit more about how ASR might work

---

## For next time

- We'll think about how to model the filter!
