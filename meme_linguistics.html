<h1>The Linguistics of Memes</h1>
<h3>Dr. Will Styler</h3>

</section>

---

### Content Warning

- This lecture will discuss memes of all types

- There will be some 'profane' language

- There will be cursed memes

---

### Aging warning

- I'm doing my best, but I've been [doing this since 2007](https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/lolcats.html)

- ![](humorimg/fellowkids.gif)

---

### Today's Plan

- What are memes?

- Are memes language?

- Why does that matter?

---

# What are memes?

---

## What is a "meme"?

> A unit of cultural information, such as a cultural practice or idea, that is transmitted verbally or by repeated action from one mind to another.

---

### 'Meme' is multifaceted

- Cultural concepts (e.g. ideas, practices, rituals)

- Physical actions (e.g. dances, planking, rickrolling)

- Language itself is memetic, by some definitions!

---

### More 'memey' uses of meme

- Phrases with codified meaning

    - "You love to see it"

    - "Kony 2012"

    - "We have 69 copies left." "Nice."

    - "F in the chat"

---

### Uncaptioned but meme-y images

![](humorimg/side_eye_chloe.jpg)

---

### Captioned images

![](humorimg/ohsnapmccain.jpg)

---

### Videos and GIFs

- [[dʒɪfs]](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2020/02/25/how-do-you-say-gif-properly-ask-giphy-jif/4750684002/)

- ![](memes/stickroll.gif)

---

### We're going to focus on images today

- In the modern, internet-focused definition of 'meme'

- ... but these same arguments could be made for videos, phrases, etc...

---

# Are memes linguistic?

---

### What makes language languagey?

- There are many people who've talked about this!

- There's not a consensus on exactly what makes Language language

- ... but there are a number of features which most folks agree on

- **If memes are language, they should fit these characteristics!**

---

### Language Characteristics

- Semanticity

- Arbitrariness of form and meaning

- Speaker knowledge of grammaticality

- Full productivity and creativity

- Social transmission

- Compositionality

- Accomplishes linguistic functions (e.g. assertions, questions, commands, expressives)

---

## Semanticity

---

### Elements of language have meaning

- The /-z/ suffix in 'memes' has a defined meaning

- "Penguin" has a defined meaning

- "I went to the park" has a defined meaning

---

### Memes are meaningless

- ![](humorimg/drake_nah.jpg)

---

### Memes have meaning

- ![](humorimg/drake_yeah.jpg)

---

## Arbitraryness

---

### Arbitrariness of form and meaning

- The meaning of ⛄ is closely related to its form, it is 'iconic'

- The meaning of /kæt/ is *not* related to its form

- In language, the relationship between form and meaning is *arbitrary*

---

### Meme Iconicity

- Memes are often strongly iconic

    - Relying on facial expressions

    - Photos of situations

    - The meaning of 'templates' is based on their image

- Meanings are often grounded in specific cultural contexts

- Memes can become more abstract and less iconic over time!

---

---

![](humorimg/howaboutno.jpg)

---

![](humorimg/orly.jpg)

---

![](memes/tell_me_y.jpg)

---

### Some meanings require a bit more understanding

---

![](morphology/brian_blank.jpg)

---

![](memes/inevitable.jpg)

---

### ... but memes can become more abstract

---

### Abstraction of memes

- Many memes are iconic, but some templates and meme formats can approach arbitrariness!

- Very concrete and iconic memes can detach from their forms

### Content Warning: Miscarriage

---

### Loss

- Originally posted by the webcomic [Ctrl+Alt+Del](https://cad-comic.com/)

- A very serious comic about the author and his wife losing a pregnancy

---

![](memes/loss/loss_original.jpg)

---

### Loss

- This comic was... strongly criticized

    - Didn't fit the tone of the strip

    - The dramatic element was widely considered to be poorly done

- Vigorous parody began

- Hiding 'Loss' references became a meme of itself

    - 'Is this loss?'

---

![](memes/loss/loss_original.jpg)

---

![](memes/loss/loss_translation.jpg)

---

![](memes/loss/loss_corona.jpg)

---

![](memes/loss/loss_thingseverybodyhates.jpg)

---

![](memes/loss/loss_legolas.jpg)

---

### Sharing disguised loss memes is a meme of its own

- (and it's not one that's widely appreciated)

- ![](humorimg/crow_of_judgement.jpg)

---

### Loss memes have become very abstract

- Distant from the original iconic form of Loss

---

### So, many meme templates are mostly iconic

- Some require cultural or social knowledge

- ... and some have abstracted away from iconicity completely

- **This one's questionable for memes!**

---

## Grammaticality Judgements

---

### Speakers of a language know 'correct' and 'incorrect' forms

- There are 'conventions' which are by and large followed

- "Mara went to the store with Darnell"

- *"Somebody set up us the bomb.  All your base are belong to us."

---

### Memers know when memes are 'grammatical' and 'correct

- Memes can be ungrammatical

- Meme forms can be used incorrectly

---

![](morphology/babymeme1.jpg)

---

![](morphology/babymeme4.jpg)

---

![](morphology/babymeme_wrong.jpg)

---

![](memes/ungrammatical/pokewrong.jpg)

---

![](memes/ungrammatical/zoomclass.jpg)

---

### Memes are able to be 'wrong'

- Not cursed or 'bad', but not good uses of the form or template

- These mirror linguistic grammaticality judgements of speakers

- **This one checks out!**

---

![](morphology/babymeme_brian.jpg)

---

## Productivity and Creativity

---

### Language is productive and creative

- Language can produce an infinite set of meanings

- Sub-elements of language can be recombined to produce new and different language

- Language can be used to describe anything (given time!)

---

### Memes are productive

- Able to be adapted to new scenarios

- Templates can be combined or re-used to create new memes

- Memes can be combined to produce new memes

---

![](ling_memes/japanese_vowels.jpg)

---

![](ling_memes/academic_debate.jpg)

---

![](memes/abstraction/catcreation.jpg)

---

### Memes are creative

- New memes can be created for situations

- 'You've got a meme for everything'

---

![](ling_memes/exemplar_ring.jpg)

---

![](ling_memes/measure_nasality_acoustically.jpg)

---

### New meme templates can always be born

- See [Reddit's /r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/)

- ... and the rest of the internet

---

### [Tiger King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_King) was released on March 20th, 2020

- ![](memes/financially_recover.jpg)

---

*![](memes/tiger_king_salad_cat.jpg)

---

### Images can go from 'funny image' to 'meme template' with repeated use

- This is referred to as 'lexicalization' when it happens to words

---

### Memes can be used to describe any situation

- ... and new memes can be generated to fill in any gaps

- Memes are both **creative** and **productive**

---

## Traditional Transmission

---

### Language is learned from others' language use

- Our language is dictated by the language we're exposed to

- Cultural knowledge is included

- Our language represents our social groups

---

### Memes are transmitted traditionally

- Memes are culturally and socially specific

- Memes spread within subcultures before reaching 'mainstream'

- We can tell facts about people from their meme choices

- Some memes need in-group knowledge to be understood

---

### Memes from Will's Era

![](memes/oldmeme.jpg)

![](humorimg/serious_cat.jpg)

---

![](humorimg/youwinthisround.jpg)

---

### Boomer memes

![](memes/boomer/boomer_lifeguard.jpg)

---

![](memes/boomer/boomer_clocks.jpg)

---

![](memes/boomer/boomer_younger.jpg)

---

![](memes/boomer/boomer_food.jpg)

---

![](memes/meme_generations.jpg)

---

### Memes can 'index' certain identities and social affiliations

---

![](memes/trans_talking_about_gender.jpg)

---

![](memes/nevercomingout.jpg)

---

![](memes/pepe.jpg)

---

![](ling_memes/languagefacts.jpg)

---

### Memes often need in-group knowledge

---

![](memes/watch_lvmh.jpg)

---

![](memes/watch_okboomer.jpg)

---

![](ling_memes/slavic_accusative.jpg)

---

![](ling_memes/pie_lana_del_rey.jpg)

---

![](memes/sociolinguistics.jpg)

---

### Memes have traditional transmission

- They are learned from other meme users

- They are bundled with and index sociocultural information

- Your upbringing and environment play a strong role in determining how you use and understand them

- **Yup, that's languagey!**

---

## Compositionality

---

### Language is compositional

- Larger wholes are made up of smaller parts, each contributing part of the meaning

- 'Unlockable' (un+lock+able)

- "I'm never gonna give you up."

---

### Memes are compositional

- The captions themselves carry meaning (duh)

- Meme templates carry meaning too!

- Other stylistic elements can carry meaning

---

### Meme template meaning

- Changing ONLY the template changes the meaning

- Minimal pairs are possible

    - Mememes?

---

![](memes/form/generative_usage_button.jpg)

---

![](memes/form/generative_usage_drake.jpg)

---

![](memes/form/generative_usage_will.jpg)

---

### Meme style cues have meaning in isolation too

---

![](memes/form/impact_font.jpg)

---

![](memes/deepfried_1.jpg)

---

![](memes/form/allisonbell.jpg)

---

### Memes are compositional!

- They're evaluable in terms of many components, each contributing meaning

- These meaning components are productive, and can be re-used elsewhere

---

## Linguistic Functions

---

### Language accomplishes functions

- We can make simple assertive sentences
    
    - "The duck quacked at his bae"

- We can ask questions

    - "Who posted the loss meme?"

- We can issue directives

    - "Declare a LING major."

- We can express our feelings

    - "I'm confused by deep fried memes"

- We can change things about the world

    - "I sentence you to ten hours of community service"

---

### Memes can make simple assertions

- ![](memes/emotional_support_dog.jpg)

---

### Memes can ask questions

- ![](humorimg/whynotboth.jpg)

---

### Memes can issue directives

- ![](humorimg/dewit.gif)

---

### Memes can express our feelings

- ![](memes/confused.gif)

---

### Memes can change things about the world

- ![](memes/ban.gif)

---

### Memes can accomplish the same purposes as language!

- Boy, it sure seems like...

---

# Memes have almost all of the characteristics of language!

---

![](humorimg/coolstoryhouse.jpg)

- Why do we care?

---

## Linguistics can help us understand memes!

---

### Most subfields have meme-related questions!

- Phonology/Phonotactics

    - What form elements can co-occur?  What's not a legal combination

- Morphology

    - What are the correspondences between meme form and meaning?

    - How do memes go from funny pictures to productive chunks of meaning and form?

- Semantics

    - How do we describe the meaning of memes?

- Pragmatics

    - What effects do context and discourse have on meme meaning?

---

### Meme Linguistics continued!

- Sociolinguistics

    - What does meme use tell us about people's social life?

    - How are memes used to index social identity?

- Conversation and Discourse Analysis

    - What roles do memes play in advancing conversations and discourse?

- Translation theory

    - Can a meme be translated effectively into another language or culture?

    - Can memes be made into text?

- Diachronic Linguistics

    - How do memes change over time?
    
    - Do memes follow the same patterns as language?

---

### All that time you've spent on a linguistics degree will also help you study memes

- ![](memes/stonks.jpg)

---

### Wrapping up

- Memes are bits of cultural information which are spread from person to person

- They share many of the properties often attributed to conventional signed and spoken language

- Linguistic tools and methods are useful for their analysis
