# Speech Perception
### Sixth College Seminar - Will Styler

---

### My goal today is to convince you that speech perception is magic

---

## Today's Plan

- What is speech?

- What is speech perception?

- Some unexpected phenomena

- Why is it difficult?

---

# What is speech?

---


### The Speech Process

* Flapping bits of meat inside your head while blowing out air

* This creates vibrations in the air you're expelling

* The ear picks these up, and inteprets them as speech.

* This process is studied in the Linguistic subfield of **Phonetics**

---

### The Lungs

---

### Flapping bits of meat ("articulation")

---

### Let's do an experiment

---

> The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak.

---

### Speech is absolutely insane

- It's a series of fluid and overlapping gestures

- It's amazingly complex

- ... and it's nothing like we think it is

---

### ... but we can think about speech as a sequence of vowels and consonants

- Individual speech sounds

    - A series of articulatory targets...

    - Not the same ones as your writing system

- With hard-to-identify boundaries between them

    - Adjacent sounds affect each other

- Which is broadcasted to the world acoustically

---

### So, what do these vibrations look like?

---

---

![](phonmedia/slinky_wave.jpg)

---

### Sound is compression and rarefaction in a medium

- Sound needs something to travel in (like air or water)

- This is why a clap or gun-shot are so loud

- But these compressions and rarefactions travel

---

### Different speech gestures create different sounds

- Each element of a speech articulation has acoustical consequences

    - Combinations of different frequencies at different amplitudes over time

- Today, we'll sort of gloss over this complexity and think in theory

### How do humans pick them up?

### "Oh, he's talking about that thing up there!"

# What is Speech Perception?

---

### Well, what *is* speech perception?

Thoughts?

---

## Speech Perception

The process of turning acoustic speech signals back into linguistic content

---

### We go from this...

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/sky.png">

---

### To this...

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/skyphoto.jpg">

---

## What do we want from a theory of speech perception?

- We want it to explain how we go from the sounds we hear to language

- We want it to handle the dynamic nature of sounds

- We want it to be flexible for the variability in speech

- We want it to explain our accuracy at this *super* hard task

---

... but the thing is

- ### Speech perception is really weird

---

# Stupid Speech Perception Tricks

---

## Speaker Variation

---

![](img/bird_penguin.jpg)

---

### Every single person you meet sounds different from every other person

- Yet *you have never given even the smallest of damns*

---

## Categorical Perception

---

### Vowels are very *gradient*

- There are many possible gestures to make a vowel

- There are many positions between the tongue position for 'date' and 'debt'

- So, we should feel a very smooth progression between them?

    - Right?
    
---

### Date vs. Debt

# Date

# Debt

---

### Categorical Perception

* We use our knowledge of the categories to make strong decisions about which sounds are which

- Even when it's completely gradient!

---

### Degraded Signals

---

### Let's listen to some sounds

### Sine Wave Speech

- Recodes complex speech signals as the sum of three moving sine waves

- Sine Wave Speech demonstrates how good we are at recovering speech in the world

### Gick and Derrick 2009: "Aero-tactile integration in speech perception"

<small>Nature. 2009 November 26; 462(7272): 502â€“504. doi:10.1038/nature08572.</small>

---

> Syllables heard simultaneously with cutaneous air puffs were more likely to be heard as aspirated (for example, causing participants to mishear â€˜bâ€™ as â€˜pâ€™). These results demonstrate that perceivers integrate event-relevant tactile information in auditory perception in much the same way as they do visual information.

(from Gick and Derrick 2009: "Aero-tactile integration in speech perception")

---

## Huh.  That was weird.

---

# The Big Questions

---

### We have more questions than answers in speech perception

- But these are the three big ones

---

### How are we perceiving speech?

- Are we listening directly to the acoustics?

    - "General Auditory" theory

- Are we trying to figure out 'what they did' in terms of gestures using our own speech system?

    - Motor Theory
    
- Are we building a mental model of the mechanism that must have produced that sound?

    - 'Direct Realism' or Direct Perception
    
---


### What are we storing in our mind?

- Abstractions (e.g. /nÉ”Éªz/)

- 'Averages' from many productions

- Individual productions of words

---


### Is speech special?

- Do we process speech in the same way that we process every other acoustic stimulus?

- Do we process speech using a special language-specific or tongue/motor localized processes?

---

### So, Speech perception?

"The Large Hadron Collider is the most complex endeavor humans have ever undertaken."

---

### **Speech** is the most complex endeavor humans have ever undertaken.

- ... and speech perception is just a small part of the complexity of human language

---

### In Summary...

---

# Speech perception is Magic

- ... and that makes you all wizards
