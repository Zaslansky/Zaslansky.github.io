# Welcome to Linguistics!
### Dr. Will Styler and Alycia Randol

---

### So, you're gonna be a linguist?

---

### "Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!"

## "How many languages do you speak?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

Many linguists speak more than one language, but...

### There's way more to Linguistics than knowing languages <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Linguists study Language

* We're interested in how 'Language' works for humans

	- ... and we study it by looking at Spanish, or Laotian, or Russian, or Kumeyaay

* Learning languages can be a part of that, but it's not the whole!

---

### We're interested in Capital L 'Language'

- ... even as we're studying individual languages

---

... but we have a problem ...

---

## Language is amazingly complex

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

---

### "The duck quacked gleefully at his bae."

- How did I make that sequence of sounds and how did you recognize it?

- Why is there a [t] at the end of quack rather than a [d]?

- What does that last sound mean anyways?

- Who quacked at whom?  When?  How do we know?

- What was gleeful?

- Is the duck single? Happy?

- What's a 'bae' anyways? Can a duck have a bae?

---

### Language is complex

* ## Linguistics has to be complex too

---

### We'll look at all the complexities

- Our program deals with many of the major questions we have about language!

---

### Main Linguistic Subfields

- "How does talking work?" - Phonetics

- "How do sounds change when we combine them?" - Phonology

- "How do we build words?" - Morphology

- "How do we combine words into sentences?" - Syntax

- "What does it all mean?" - Semantics and Pragmatics

- Plus language acquisition, social factors in language, language in the brain and more!

---

# What do linguists do?

---

### Theoretical Linguistics

- How can we describe *how people communicate using language*?

- How can we describe *the things people don't do* when using language?

- What are the *most accurate models* to help us understand language?

- What are the models which *best mirror our own cognition*?

- How does language change over time?

---

### Linguistic Typology

- How do languages *generally* accomplish communicative goals?  

- Are there patterns across the world?

- What kinds of things are languages more and less likely to do?

- Are there *universal* tendencies in language?

---

### Experimental work in Linguistics!

- Studying speech and articulation using sound and physical measurements

- Studying speech and sentence processing using eyetracking

- Studying language in the brain using EEG, FMRI, and more!

- Studying all sorts of elements of language using behavioral experiments

---

### Language Documentation

### Language Documentation

---

### Computational Linguistics

- How do we make computers understand human language?

- How do we use computers to process linguistic data?

- How can we interact with computers using human language?

- What can insights from language data provide for the world?

---

### Linguistic Data Science

- How can we process, understand, and summarize language data?

- How can we integrate natural language responses into other datastreams?

- What can we learn about the people giving us data, from the language they use?

---

### Forensic Linguistics

- How can we make strong claims about authorship?

- What can we understand about a person from their language alone

- Can we use voice and language to identify people?

- How similar is 'similar' in language?

---

### Advertising and Branding

---


### Lexicography

- What words are used in English?

- What do they mean?

- Where did they come from?

---

### ... and many, many more tasks!

- Check out the [Linguistics Career Launch YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJRxM5T1SAtgT6Bhcext2Q)
