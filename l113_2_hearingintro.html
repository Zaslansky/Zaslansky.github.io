# Intro to Hearing Science and Hearing Disorders

Will Styler - LIGN 113

### The Plan

- What is sound?

- What is hearing?

- What are we covering?

- What are we skipping?

---

### What is sound?

---

![](phonmedia/slinky_wave.jpg)

---

## Sound is compression and rarefaction in a medium

- Sound needs something to travel in (like air or water)

    - Without a medium, no sound

---

### (Yes, your childhood is a lie)

![](humorimg/star_wars_battle.jpg)

---

### Thinking of sound as waves is helpful

- How do speakers work?

- Why does clapping cause a sound, but waving your hand through the air doesnâ€™t?

- Why are gunshots loud? 

- If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's around to hear it, does it still make a sound?

---

### Sound has two main properties we care about for hearing

- Amplitude/Power ("Loudness")

- Frequency ("Pitch")

---

### Amplitude/Power ("Loudness")

- High amplitude = Loud

![](phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg)

---

### Frequency ("Pitch")

- Low frequency == Low pitch

![](phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg)

---

# What is hearing?

---

### Hearing is a perceptual process

- Turning pressure variations in the audible range into their perceptual reflex

- A monolithic signal enters the ear, but a frequency-organized signal enters the mind

- **This is not a linear, clean mapping!**

- This signal is (usually) **binaural**, coming from both ears

---

### We can then turn this signal into a schema of the world


---

### Hearing is amazing

---

### Hearing is amazinger

<audio controls src="hearing/samplesound2.wav"></audio>

---

### We use hearing for amazing things

- Am I alone here?

- Am I in danger?

- "Is that sound real, or being played back by speakers?"

- "Something doesn't sound right..."

- "Are you OK?"

---

### ... but that doesn't mean hearing is perfect, either

- It is fragile

- It changes over time

- It is limited

- We don't hear sounds exactly as they are

---

### Do we hear frequency in a linear and reliable way?

Is the jump in file A the same as in file B?

A. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_600.wav"></audio>
	
B. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_10400_10600.wav"></audio>

A. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_500.wav"></audio>

B. <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_6400_6500.wav"></audio>

---

### Do we hear frequency in a linear and reliable way?

Is the jump in file A the same as in file B?

A. 400Hz - 600Hz <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_600.wav"></audio>
	
B. 10,400Hz - 10,600Hz <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_10400_10600.wav"></audio>

A. 400Hz- 500Hz <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_400_500.wav"></audio>

B. 6400Hz - 6500Hz <audio controls src="phonmedia/jump_6400_6500.wav"></audio>

---

### So, hearing can be studied in a few different ways

- Anatomically (What are the physical structures?)

- Acoustically (What are we hearing?)

- Physiologically (How does this work in the body?)

- Behaviorally (How do we respond to sound?)

---

## Hearing Science

Scientific study of the structures, mechanisms, functions, and behavioral results of human hearing

---

### ... but hearing relies on many complex structures and systems

- So it can fail!

---

## Hearing Disorders

Physiological or Physical diseases, conditions or traumas resulting in sub-normal hearing ability

---

### This course is structured broadly in six main segments

- Anatomy of Hearing

- Acoustics

- Physiology of Hearing

- Psychoacoustics

- Hearing Disorders and Testing

- Hearing Interventions

---

### Anatomy

- What are the structures of the ear?

- How are they connected?

- How do we divide the ear into subparts?

- *What elements of human anatomy are important for hearing?*

---

### Acoustics

- What is sound?

- What are its characteristics?

- How is it transmitted?

- How can we visualize, measure, and understand sound?

- What sounds and parts of the sound spectrum are most important for quality of life?

- *What is hearing picking up on, anyways?*

---

### Physiology

- How does the ear *work*?

- How does the cochlea work?

- What reflexes, phenomena, and physiological processes aid, protect, and influence hearing?

- How is auditory information transmitted to the brain?

- What happens once it's there?

- *How does hearing work in humans?*

---

### Psychoacoustics

- Are we perceiving sounds as they really are in the world?

- How do we perceive acoustic phenomena like pitch and loudness?

- How is hearing *non-linear*?

- How can we tell where sound is coming from in the world aroud us?

- *How are we processing and intepreting our auditory input?*

---

### Hearing Disorders and Testing

- What are common causes of hearing loss?

- What physiological processes are affected by various disorders?

- Where do these disorders come from?  How do they develop?

- How can we identify and diagnose them?

- What is the role of audiologists in this process?

---

### Hearing Interventions

- What methods are used to treat hearing disorders for patients who feel that desire?

- What medical interventions exist?

- What surgical interventions exist?

- How do hearing aids work?  Who do they help?

- How do cochlear implants work? What are their downsides

- *What causes hearing loss, and how can it be treated for folks who want that?*

---

## One big note

---

### This course will take a clinical, treatment-focused approach

- We will take a more medical approach, 'restoring towards common function'

- We will refer to deafness and hearing loss as 'disordered'

- We will talk about 'treating' hearing loss

- We will discuss Cochlear implants and Hearing Aids and their effects on quality of life

- This is because this is the approach taken in most Audiology programs!

---

### This *does not* mean this is the 'correct' attitude or approach

- There are many perspectives, particularly within the Deaf community, on hearing 'loss' and hearing 'treatment'

    - It's not great to call an element of somebody's identity a 'disorder'

- Understand that the point here is to understand the systems in play

    - Such that you can later help guide people towards the best choices for them

- We'll talk more about this Friday!

---

# What won't we be covering this quarter?

---

### Topics we're skipping in Anatomy

- Greater biological processes supporting hearing

- Anything at the other end of the auditory nerves

- Surrounding anatomy of the head and neck

- Anything developmental!

---

### Topics we're skipping in Acoustics

- Electronic filtering

- Digital Signal Processing and Digital Enhancement of Audio

- Infrasound and 20,000 Hz+ noise

- Electrical Engineering for hearing science

---

### Topics we're skipping in physiology

- Processing of auditory signals inside the brain

- Development and growth of the auditory system

---

### Topics we're skipping in psychoacoustics

- Musical psychoacoustics (e.g. missing fundamentals, sound 'aesthetics')

- Applied psychoacoustics (e.g. music therapy, product design, etc)

- Behavioral differences associated with assisted and CI hearing

---

### Topics we're skipping in hearing disorders

- Many, MANY less common disorders

- Auditory Processing Disorders

- (Most) trauma-related hearing loss

---

### Topics we're skipping in hearing interventions

- Hearing aid fitting

- Cochlear implant configuration, training, and adjustment

---

### Do you have any other curiosities?

- What else would you like to learn about hearing?

    - Even if it's been discused as 'skipped'?
    
---

### This quarter...

- We'll talk about the ears

- Sound

- How we're able to hear

- ... and what it's like when it goes right, and wrong!

---

## For Next Time

- Differing perspectives on hearing science, and the importance and compassion and choice

- **Please do the reading on Canvas**
