## Class Administration

---

### The Syllabus

<https://savethevowels.org/168>

---

### What are we assuming you know?

- Basic Understanding of Computers
	- How to install software, open files, and very basic concepts like 'binary' and 'data transmission'

- LING 101 Level understanding of Language
	- Concepts like dialects, phonology, homophones, orthography, IPA

- Basic Familiarity with Natural Language Processing
	- You should use or have used some NLP tools or 'Virtual Assistants'
	- Playing with ChatGPT or a similar LLM is wise

---

### What are we assuming you know? (Part 2)

- Articulatory Phonetics Knowledge
	- 'Alveolar' vs. 'Velar' and similar articulatory concepts
	- Concepts like 'Pitch/F0', 'Prosody', 'Formants'

- Basic ability to see and understand Python code
	- Look at commented code and know what chunk is doing what and how, and to modify the code to suit your needs

- **If you're lacking any these things, find somebody to work with where you can team up and form a complementary distribution**

---

### There may be bits of review

- Folks who've had LIGN 6 or 112 or 113 will have seen some of this

- **Help your classmates!**

---

### How are we teaching you this quarter?

- In Class Sessions
	- Giving you content and knowledge to apply
	
- Readings and Viewings
	- Giving you external places to learn more about the topics 

- Homeworks and Discussions
	- Giving you places to play with the concepts we're discussing

- Lab Sessions
	- Giving you a place to get easy help

- Final Projects
	- Giving you a place to dive deep

---

### External Teaching Tools

- You'll need to purchase a "Premium" Cengage Doculinx rental license to access readings and assignments ($349)

- You'll need a Thomson Reuters SignalExpert license ($349.99 for the quarter, course code NGGYU)

- WebClickers haven't worked out, so we'll be using the iClicker/Texas Instruments TiClick Calcuclicker package ($235, use code "LIGN168STYLER" to reduce that to $174.99)

- All assignments should be submitted as Microsoft Office 365 links on my Chillet UGradeU board ($4.95/assignment submission fee, code "STYUCSD")

- **This entire slide is an April Fools joke, screw expensive and proprietary Educational Technology**

	- If it isn't open, it doesn't belong on a campus

---

### Homeworks and Discussions

- Discussions (Submitted on Canvas)
	- Focused on testing and conceptual issues

- Homeworks (Submitted on Gradescope)
	- Focused on implementation

---

### Final Project

- Proposal is due Week 8

- Due in Finals Week

- Self Graded using a Rubric

- Two different tracks are available
	- Experimentation and Implementation

---

### Teamwork is Encouraged

- Work together on your homeworks

- Work together on your Final Project
	- Up to Five People
	- Linguists and Computer Folks should pair up

---

### The Emergency Button

- Email your TA no more than 24 hours after a due date for an instant extension until Wednesday

- You can press the button once this quarter, or take a 2% bonus on your final grade if unpressed

---

### You should show up, but attendance isn't required

- This is an upper division class, so it's your choice to make

- WebClickers will be used, but the points won't 'count'

- Students who choose not to attend generally do worse

- Students who do attend regularly have an advantage because....

---

### Sincere effort is incredibly important to me

- 'Blow off' the class, or try to lawyer or cajole your way into an A, and you'll find much no sympathy nor help

	- Low effort, low integrity, or 'cut-corners' work insults the people who you need help from
	
- Put in the effort for us, and weâ€™ll put in effort for you

	- We will bend over backwards to help students who are making a sincere effort

- **If you're struggling, talk to us ASAP**

---

### This is a new class!

- We're trying to make this as good as we can in round 1, but there may be bumps and changes

- Some things may not work well, or may need tweaking

- **Please pardon our dust!**

---

## Speech Processing Tasks

---

### Speech Interaction Tasks

- Take this person's Carl's Jr. Order without a second human involved

- "Hey Google, Play Despacito"

- "Please tell me what you're calling about today. You can say "Macbook Pro"

- Is this person saying 'Hey Google'? If so, trigger recognition of what follows.

---

### Speech Recognition Tasks

- Listen to all support calls and flag mentions of competitor products

- Listen to all Discord calls, and target calls mentioning breakups for Ben and Jerry's Ads

- Transcribe this recording, word-for-word ('Automatic Transcription')

- Tell me the temporal boundaries of each word and sound in this file ('Forced Alignment')

---

### Speech Synthesis Tasks

- "Please place the items back in the bagging area"

- Read this automatically generated weather report constantly on this radio channel

- Turn this eBook into an audio book

- Give [a fictional singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsune_Miku) a voice ('Vocaloid')

- Read everything on screen aloud over headphones ('Screen Readers')

---

### Pure Speech Measurement Tasks

- What's the pitch and what are the formants in this vowel? (Pitch Tracking and LPC)

- Does this person sound angry? Sad?

- Does this person have Parkinson's disease?

- Measure the amount of time this child spends hearing adult voices, child voices, and TV voices

---

### Speech Modification Tasks

- Compress and transmit this person's voice across this digitally encrypted channel/cell network without sending the waveform (Speech Codecs)

- Make [T-Pain's Whole Career](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Pain) (AutoTune)

- Remove all background noise from this helicopter pilot's transmissions (Denoising)

- Make this whistleblower's voice sound unrecognizable

---

## What's in and out of scope?

---

### Modern Natural Language Processing is Pipeliney

- The process of using (e.g.) Siri is a multi-step process

- The output of one step flows into the next

- We can think of these steps as being discrete, and study them as such

---

### We will look at four main questions this quarter

- How do computers turn speech into numbers (and back)?

- How do computers turn speech into text?

- How do computers turn text into speech?

- How do computers *modify* speech?

---

### How do computers turn speech into numbers (and back)?

- How do sound waves become binary strings?

- How do we extract meaningful features (e.g. pitch, formants)?

- How do we turn speech into a matrix of useful numbers?

- How do we turn speech into a *compressed* and more efficient representation?

---

### How do computers turn those numbers into text?

- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)

- Wake Word Detection

- Determining the most probable string based on ambiguous words

---

### How do computers turn that text into speech?

- Text-to-Speech (TTS, 'Speech Synthesis')

- Modifying the 'voice' of TTS models

- Proper pronunciations, timing, prosody

---

### How do computers modify speech?

- How do we filter a speaker's voice out of noise?

- How do we transmit a voice with encryption/efficiency?

- How do we change the characteristics of a voice (autotune/resynthesis)

- How do we replace one voice with another ('voice deepfakes')?

---

### All of this forms a loop in many NLP tasks!

<img class='r-stretch' src='diagrams/speech_processing_pipeline.jpg'>

---

### We're ignoring the steps between 'Query String' and 'Response String'

- Text processing is fascinating, but out of our scope

	- So is actually figuring out the response to the user query

- We're going to assume a perfect 'AI' model in the middle

	- All text strings are perfectly processed with perfect answers returned

- **LIGN 167 will tell you how this part works!**

---

### We're also going to focus on English

- This is hard enough in any language

- The 'State of the Art' tools are currently built for English

- We'll talk about some differences, but we'll focus on the basics here

- We're going to assume modern devices and good sound quality

---

## What's the Plan?

---

### Part 1: Computational Sound

- What is sound?

- How do computers do sound?

- How do we analyze sound?

- What is speech like?

- **Weeks 1-2**

---

### Part 2: Measuring and Modifying Speech

- How do we filter sound?

- How do we transform sound?

- How do we detect features of voices?

- How do we modify pitch? Formants?

- **Weeks 3-4**

---

### Part 3: Automatic Speech Recognition

- Why is ASR hard?

- How was it done?

- How is it done?

- How can we make it more efficient?

- What tasks go alongside speaker recognition?

- **Weeks 5-7**

---

### Part 4: Text-to-Speech

- Why is TTS hard?

- How was it done?

- How is it done?

- How can we change the voices we create?

- What *should* these voices sound like?

- **Weeks 8-10**

---

### Important questions to ask along the way

- How can we do this with respect for **linguistic diversity**?

- How can we do this with respect for **our right to privacy**?

- How can this be used to **help people**?

- How can this be used to **harm people**?

- How can these systems be **improved**?

---

### Here's hoping for a great quarter!

- Hopefully we'll learn a lot

- We'll forge a great new class

- ... and we'll have fun in the process
