# Semantic Parsing
### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---

### Today's Plan

- Verb Arguments and Verb Senses

- Semantic Frames

- Semantic Roles and Role Labeling

- How does doing any of this help us?

---

### Many words have multiple senses

- (I really hope you've figured that out already)

---

### Fit

- She fit the package into the over-full trunk

- She's fit to work on your project, given her background

- She's having fits about the new deadline

- She's quite fit for her age

- That fit nicely into my schedule

- She fits in well in San Diego

---

### Fire

- They fired 10 rounds at the target

- They fired him after 10 years

- They fired the pot in the kiln

- The engine is fired by a steady stream of coal

- The fire was started by lightning

---

### Hit

- I hit the dragon with an arrow

- SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share

- Rob loves to hit the golf course on Fridays

- The mafia hit stunned the local government

- The fingerprints had three hits on old records

- I hit on the dragon at the sleazy bar

- I hit up the dragon for some gold until payday

---

### Oh no.

---

### Not all verbs take the same arguments!

- Some verbs don't take an object

	- "I dreamed"

- Some verbs take an object always

	- "I hit the dragon"

- Some verbs take two objects

	- "I baked Jessica a cake"

- **Different verbs demand different arguments**

---

## Argument

Some element of a sentence which helps complete the principal meaning of the sentence.

- **Will** hit **the dragon**

- **Mary** baked **Sam** **a cake**

- **Maria** fired **six rounds**.

---

### It gets worse...

---

### Different verb *senses* demand different arguments

---

### Hit (strike)

"I hit the dragon with an arrow"

- Thing doing the hitting

- Thing being hit

- How the hitting is done (manner, or instrument)

---

### Hit (a value)

"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share"

- Thing hitting the level/goal/landmark

- The level/goal/landmark

- *No instrument argument is possible*

	- *"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share with a good economy"

---

### Hit (go to activity)

"Rob loves to hit the bowling alley with his friends"

- Person going to the activity (animate)

- Activity

- *Doesn't take an inanimate subject or an instrument*

	- *"The ball hit the links on weekends"
	
	- *"Rob loves hitting the ballfield with his bat"

---

### Hit on (make sexual advances)

"Sherry hit on Steve at the party"

- Person making the advances

- Person hit on

- *No instrument is permissible*

	- ?"Sherry hit on Steve with a bad joke"
	
---

### Hit up (to request)

"I hit up the dragon for some gold"

- Person making the request

- Request

- Requested from

- *All three arguments are required*

	- "I hit up the dragon" (For?)

	- "I hit up for money" (Who?)
	
	- "Hit up for money" (???)
	
	- Can't be ditransitive (*"I hit up the dragon some gold")
	
---

### Fire

- They fired 10 rounds at the target

- They fired him after 10 years

- They fired the pot in the kiln

- The engine is fired by a steady stream of coal

- The fire was started by lightning

---


### We can think of every verb sense as having a "Frame"

- A set of arguments which it expects

- ... which combine to give the overall meaning of the sentence

- This is the idea behind *Frame Semantics*

- These are *lexically specific*

- **This information can be seen as a part of the verb's meaning**

---

### Every verb sense has a frame

- The [PropBank Project](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/) has been working to produce frames for every verb in large chunks of text

- [Here's the list of frames by verb](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/framesets-english-aliases/)

---

### Cower

> Will cowered in fright at the number of projects to grade

Roles:

- Arg0-PPT: afraid entity (vnrole: 40.5-Experiencer, 40.6-Experiencer) 

---

### Demolish

> Lancelot demolished the unholy altar

- Arg0-PAG: destroyer (vnrole: 44-Agent, 31.1-Stimulus)
- Arg1-PPT: thing destroyed (vnrole: 44-Patient, 31.1-Experiencer)
- Arg2-MNR: instrument of destruction (vnrole: 44-Instrument) 

---

### Conquer

> Alexander the Great conquered Halicarnassus and its Persian occupants

- Arg0-PAG: conquering hero, agent (vnrole: 42.3-agent)
- Arg1-PPT: entity conquered, spoils (if unclear whether the spoils or the loser, use this arg) (vnrole: 42.3-patient)
- Arg2-PPT: defeated entity; loser; former owner of arg1 (vnrole: 42.3-patient) 

---

### Cuddle

> The two cats cuddled on the couch

- Arg1-PAG: one half (vnrole: 36.2-agent)
- Arg2-COM: second half (vnrole: 36.2-co-agent) 

---

### Different verb senses have different argument structures

---

### Hit (to strike)

> Vladimir hit the orc with his spear

- Arg0-PAG: agent, hitter - animate only! (vnrole: 18.1-1-agent, 40.8.3-experiencer, 17.1-1-agent) 
- Arg1-GOL: thing hit (vnrole: 18.4-location, 18.1-1-patient, 40.8.3-patient, 47.8-1-theme, 17.1-1-theme) 
- Arg2-MNR: instrument, thing hit by or with (vnrole: 18.4-theme, 18.1-1-instrument, 47.8-1-co-theme) 

---

### Hit (to reach)

> The twitch streamer hit 6000 subscribers

- Arg0-PAG: thing hitting / reaching (vnrole: 51.8-agent) 
- Arg1-GOL: thing hit (vnrole: 51.8-destination) 

---

### Hit (the links)

> Jian hit the beach to do some surfing

- Arg0-PAG: entity turning to a new hobby 
- Arg1-PPT: thing hit 

---

### Many verbs have optional arguments too

- These are marked as 'ArgM'
- COM: Comitative ('with', but not manner)
- LOC: Locative 
- DIR: Directional 
- GOL: Goal
- MNR: Manner
- TMP: Temporal
- EXT: Extent
- REC: Reciprocals
- PRP: Purpose
- CAU: Cause

---

### More 'ARGM' types of arguments

- DIS: Discourse 
- ADV: Adverbials 
- ADJ: Adjectival 
- MOD: Modal
- NEG: Negation 
- DSP: Direct Speech

---

### The Emperor recently completely demolished the Cruiser in the Endor system with the Death Star to crush the Rebels

- Arg0-PAG: Emperor
- Arg1-PPT: Cruiser
- Arg2-MNR: Death Star
- ArgM-???: Recently
- ArgM-???: Completely
- ArgM-???: In the Endor system
- ArgM-???: To crush the rebels

---

### The Emperor recently completely demolished the Cruiser in the Endor system with the Death Star to crush the Rebels

- Arg0-PAG: Emperor
- Arg1-PPT: Cruiser
- Arg2-MNR: Death Star
- ArgM-TMP: Recently
- ArgM-EXT: Completely
- ArgM-LOC: In the Endor system
- ArgM-GOL: To crush the rebels

---

### OK, so verbs have frames, and arguments!

- ... but verbs aren't the only thing that has a frame

---

## Predications

- A predication is something that's said about the subject of the sentence

---

### Types of Predication

- Mice **like cheese**.

- Will **is a linguist**.

- Jamba Juice pretzels **are alright as as food**.

- I'm **sorry about the puns**.

- His students **find Will to be strange**

---

### Non-Verbal Predications have semantic frames too!

- "Sorry"

- "Angry"

- "Hangry"

- "Romantic"

---

### Underappreciated

- Arg0-PAG: underappreciator

- Arg1-PPT: thing not valued highly enough

---

### Anxious

- Arg0-CAU: cause of anxiety -- anxious over/about what?

- Arg1-CAU: nervous entity

---

### Nonfunctioning

- Arg0-PAG: non-worker

- Arg1-PRD: job, project

---

### Overweight

- Arg1-PPT: overweight entity

- Arg2-EXT: amount over weight

- Arg3-PRD: weight measurement

---

### Different adjective senses take different sets of arguments

---

### Lit (as in a building)

- Arg0-CAU: thing providing light

- Arg1-PPT: object which is covered in light

---

### Lit (as in a party)

- Arg0-PPT: event which is off the hook

---

### This process gives us two important pieces of information

- What arguments that a given predication **expects**

- What the **semantic nature** of these arguments is

---

# Why do we need any of this?

---

## These representations are *independent of syntax*

---

### The argument structure doesn't change with word order

- Will hit the dragon with an arrow.

- It was the dragon that Will hit with an arrow.

- Will used an arrow to hit the dragon.

- An arrow was used by Will to hit the dragon.

- The dragon, with an arrow, was hit.

---

## Word sense disambiguation gets easier!

---

### Knowing things about verb semantics helps 

- Hit Verb: Dependency parse shows three arguments: "rock", "dragon", "Will"

- Hit Verb: Parse shows "1000 points" and "Score".

- Fit Adj: Parse shows only one argument, 'he'

- Fit Adj: Parse shows two arguments, 'co-pilot', 'fly'

---

## It helps us understand text better

---

### Once you know a verb's sense, you know what to expect

- "Uh oh.  There's firing going on. It's the business sense. We should find the argument doing the firing, who's being fired, and where they're being fired from."
	
- "Uh, wait, this is the "fired a gun" sense. We need to know what argument was fired, who pulled the trigger, and who, if anything, was fired at."

- **You can track down the arguments that you didn't find!**

---

### Not all arguments are always given!

- "The dragon was hit by an arrow"

- "Lit!"

- "I am anxious"

- *Knowing the expected semantic roles tells you what's missing!*

---

## Frames + Dependency parsing *hands us semantics for free!*

---

## This is useful for question answering

---

### Questions often ask for arguments

- "Who was hit?" 
	- ARG1-PPT

- "Who did the hitting?"
	- ARG0-PAG

- "Where did the hitting happen?"
	- ARGM-LOC

- "When did the hitting happen?"
	- ARGM-TMP

- "Why did the hitting happen?"
	- ARGM-GOL or ARGM-CAU
	
---

### Questions and arguments continued

- "How much hitting was done?"
	- ARGM-EXT
	
- "Did anybody help?"
	- ARGM-COM

- "What was used to hit?"
	- ARGM-MNR
	
- "How was the hitting done?
	- ARGM-ADV
	
- "Was the hitting done?"
	- ARGM-NEG

---

### Answers are right in the parse

- "Who demolished the cruiser?"

- "Where was the cruiser demolished?"

- "How was the cruiser demolished?"

- "Why was the cruiser demolished?"

---

## This can be done automatically!

---

### We're good at automatic semantic role labeling

- "Given this dependency parse, identify the arguments"

	- Or, "Give me the dependency parse and arguments"

- Around 90% precision (e.g. correct labels detected)

- Around 80% recall (e.g. cases for labeling found)

---

## This can be expanded

---

### The AMR Project

- The [AMR (Abstract Meaning Representations) Project](https://amr.isi.edu/index.html) builds on this work

	- [A great introductory slide show](https://github.com/nschneid/amr-tutorial/tree/master/slides)

- Brings additional elements to verb frames to enrich what's captured

- Aims to create abstract meaning graphs from sentences which can be used for understanding

- "Similar meanings will have similar representations"

---

## Semantic Representations like these are powerful

---

### Once we know the verb sense and the syntax, we know...

- What arguments are expected

- What arguments are missing

- How to answer questions

- How to represent meaning independent of syntax

---

## This is called 'Semantic Parsing'

---

### Semantic Parsing turns language data into a machine-usable semantic representation

- These are 'shallow semantic parses'

	- Also called 'slot filling' or 'frame semantic parsing'
	
- There are deeper semantic parses

	- Going to lambda-calculus or other semantic representations

- ... but this is what Alexa does, along with many other systems

---

### Use this for your projects!

- When you're asking a question, think what role-labels you're asking for?

- This is one of the most powerful things we're talking about all quarter!

---

### Use this for your projects!

- When you're asking a question, think what role-labels you're asking for?

- This is one of the most powerful things we're covering this quarter

- Think about queries and responses as semantic parses in your option 1 project!

---

### Wrapping up

- Different word senses take different sets of arguments

- Knowing about predications and arguments helps us understand verbs better

- There are many semantic roles which can be found

- This kind of semantic parsing is *really* helpful in NLP

---

### For Next Time

- We'll look at a different semantic domain: Events
