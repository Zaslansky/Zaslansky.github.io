### Would you still have taken LIGN 101 if it were a lower-division class?

- A) Yes, because it's a major requirement

- B) Yes, absolutely

- C) Yes, but I'm glad it counts as upper division

- D) No, it wouldn't have appealed to me as lower division class

- E) No, it wouldn't satisfy requirements I need as a lower division class

---

### Reminders

- All grades are final seven days after they are released

	- All other grades are final at the start of the exam
	
	- Double-check everything next week!

- Clicker and SONA scores are being sorted soon

- SET evaluations are currently at 51.28%, so unfortunately no extra credit yet; I'll give it until the end of the day

- https://sites.google.com/view/matthewzaslansky/exampolicies has all the information you want

- We'll have a study session next Week (Monday 4-6pm in CENTR 222)

# Linguistics 101: An Introduction to Language
### Dr. Matt Zaslansky

---

### Today's Plan

- Where we've been...

- ...where we're going: Your Linguistic Future

- ...and where <strong>I've</strong> been

- A Life in Language

- The Secret to Great Linguistic Analysis

---

# Where we've been

---

### We've only gotten a small taste of linguistic diversity

- We've seen data from a lot of language, but we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg

- This diversity isn't arbitrary or apparent only at the marginal fringes. It's a core defining feature of what makes language human

---

### Diversity: Phonology

- From consonant inventories...

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_consonant_inv.png">

<small>([From WALS](https://wals.info/feature/1A#2/19.3/152.8))</small>


---

### Diversity: Phonology

- ...to vowel inventories...

---

### Diversity: Phonology

<img class="small" src="img/wals_consonant_inv_legend.png">
<img class="small" src="img/wals_vowel_inv_legend.png">

---

### Diversity: Phonology

- ...to where we find tone and how complex it is...

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_tone.png">

<small>([From WALS](https://wals.info/feature/13A#1/22/157))</small>

---

### Diversity: Phonology

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_tone_legend.png">

---

### Diversity: Phonology

- ...even to which consonants are common and where!

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_common_consonants_legend.png"></p>

### Diversity: Phonology

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_common_consonants.png">

<small>([From WALS](https://wals.info/feature/18A#2/14.3/205.1))</small>	

---

### And that's just some phonological elements

- There's plenty of variation in morphology and syntax too

---

### Diversity: Morphology

- Morphology is perhaps the area where we see the most variation across languages 

- Just think of gender!

	- Some languages, like Turkish, completely lack it
	
	- Some languages, like English, have it only in pronouns
	
	- Some languages, like Russian, have it everywhere

---

### Russian Gender

- sobaka vidye-la koshk-u
	- dog.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST cat-ACC.FEM
	- "The dog saw the cat."

- ya vidye-la koshk-u
	- 1SG.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST cat-ACC.FEM
	- "I saw the dog [and I am a woman]."

- ya vidye-l sobak-u 
	- 1SG.NOM see-SG.MASC.PST dog-ACC.FEM
	- "I saw the dog [and I am a man]."

---

### Diversity: Morphological gender

- Turns out there's more variation in this than just having or not having gender...

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_gender_legend.png">

<small>([From WALS](https://wals.info/feature/30A#2/26.7/148.9))</small>	

---

### Diversity: Morphological gender

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_gender.png">

---

### Diversity: Morphological gender

- Languages like Arapesh (Torricelli, Papua New Guinea), have either as few as 13 genders or as many as 22 genders, depending on how you look at it.

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/arapesh.png">

<small>(Source: Corbett & Fraser 2000)</small>	

---

### Diversity: Syntax

- Even the basic building blocks of our sentences vary

- Remember word order?

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wals_word_order_legend.png">

# Your Linguistic Future

---

### Admit it...

- Some part of what we've learned about Linguistics has been fun!

- To find out more about majors or minors, contact <linginfo@ling.ucsd.edu> :)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/joinme.jpg">

---

### Many of you are already linguists and don't know it yet

- Serial language learners

- Language Analyzers

- Easily distracted by odd language use

- People fascinated by the differences and similarities among languages

- *If any of those things sound like you, you might be a linguist*

---

### I started college as a Geology major

- I wanted to be a volcanologist

	- I thought it would get me free trips to Hawai'i and that sounded cool.

- Then Linguistics hunted me down.

---

## Case Systems

---

### Grammatical Relations

How a language marks who did what to whom

---

### English uses word order to mark grammatical relations.

- ... but that's not the only way!

---

## Case Marking

- Use of inflectional morphemes to mark Grammatical Relations

---

### Russian has case markers

* Each case marker corresponds to a grammatical role

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Object"

---

### Russian Case Marking

- sobaka vidye-la koshk-u
- dog.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST cat-ACC.FEM
- "The dog saw the cat."

- koshka vidye-la sobak-u 
- cat.NOM see-SG.FEM.PST dog-ACC.FEM
- "The cat saw the dog."

---

### Russian Case Marking

- Ya tyebya vizh-u
- I.NOM you.ACC see-1SG
- "I see you"

- Ti myenya vid-ish
- you.NOM I.ACC see-2SG
- "You see me"

---

<section class="clicker"></section>

### If we put the sentence "Niloo hugged the turtle" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - ACC

B) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - NOM

C) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - NOM

D) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - ACC

---

### If we put the sentence "Niloo hugged the turtle" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) <correct>Niloo - NOM, Turtle - ACC</correct>

B) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - NOM

C) Niloo - NOM, Turtle - NOM

D) Niloo - ACC, Turtle - ACC

---

### In Russian, Word order can be used for Pragmatics

* Koshka videla sobaku
	* "The cat saw the dog"

* Videla koshka sobaku
	* "The cat saw the dog"

* Sobaku videla Koshka
	* "The cat saw the dog"

- Russian is a "non-configurational" language

---

### English has some case too!

* I see him
* I-NOM see he-ACC

* He sees me
* He-NOM see-3sg I-ACC

---

### You know what other language has case?

---

<lang>Quenya</lang><br><ldata>Eldarin</ldata> 

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/galadriel.jpg"> 
---

(... and I didn't think I was a linguist)

<img src="img/lotr.png"> 

---

### ... but Russian has more cases!

---

## The Russian Case System

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Direct Object"

* **Dative Case** - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* **Genitive Case** - "The Possessor (and more)"

* **Locative Case** - "The Location (and more)"

* **Instrumental Case** - "The Tool (and more)"

---

### Genitive Case

Marks possession

---

### Genitive Case in Action

* Ya vi-zhu sharik sobak-i
* 1sg.NOM see-1sg ball-ACC dog-GEN
* "I see the dog's ball"

---

### Locative Case

Marks the location of events

* (this is also called the "Prepositional Case")

---

### Locative Case in action

- Ya zhiv-u v Californi-i
- 1sg.NOM live-1sg in California-LOC
- "I live in California"

---

### Instrumental Case

Marks an object being used

---

### Instrumental Case in Action

* Andres pish-et karandash-om
* Andres-NOM write-3sg pencil-INST
* "Andres writes with a pencil"

* Ya yem borscht so smetanoy
* 1sg-NOM eat borscht-ACC with sour.cream-INST
* "I eat borscht with sour cream"

---

### Dative Case

Marks the indirect object, or recipient of an item

---

### Dative Case

* Kevin dayot tsvet-i Lis-ye
* Kevin-NOM give.3sg Flowers-ACC.PLUR Lisa-DAT
* "Kevin gave Lisa flowers"

* Enchilad-i mne da-la Niloo 
* Enchilada-ACC.PLUR 1sg.DAT give-PAST.FEM Niloo-NOM
* "Niloo gave me Enchiladas"

---

### Dative as "Goal"

* Ya pomoga-yu Kevinu
* 1sg.NOM help-present.1sg Kevin-DAT
* "I'm helping Kevin"

* Mne zvoni-l Barack Obama
* 1sg-DAT call-past.masc Barack Obama-NOM
* "Barack Obama called me"

### If we put the sentence "Jony gave Dieter some food" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) Jony - ACC, Dieter - DAT, food - NOM

B) Jony - NOM, Dieter - DAT, food - ACC

C) Jony - NOM, Dieter - ACC, food - DAT

D) Jony - DAT, Dieter - ACC, food - NOM

---

### If we put the sentence "Jony gave Dieter some pellets" into Russian, the proper cases would be...

A) Jony - ACC, Dieter - DAT, Pellets - NOM

<correct>B) Jony - NOM, Dieter - DAT, Pellets - ACC</correct>

C) Jony - NOM, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - DAT

D) Jony - DAT, Dieter - ACC, Pellets - NOM

---

## The Russian Case System

* **Nominative Case** - "The Subject"

* **Accusative Case** - "The Direct Object"

* **Dative Case** - "The Indirect Object or Recipient"

* **Genitive Case** - "The Possessor (and more)"

* **Locative Case** - "The Location (and more)"

* **Instrumental Case** - "The Tool (and more)"

- *It's actually **way** more complicated than this!*

---

(Whoa!  That looks like some of the argument roles we saw in lexical semantics!)

---

### So, now you know the Russian system

- Just in case.

---


### English can handle Nominative and Accusative.

- I saw him

	- I.NOM saw he.DAT

* ... but Dative?  We just can't even.

---

### So, I took 'LING 1'

- <img class="r-stretch" src="people/dryer.png">

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/help_kitten.jpg">

---

### ... and then I took Phonetics

- Then Phonology and Syntax

- Then Morphology

- LIGN 8's Equivalent

- Then Semantics, then Pragmatics

- Then some independent studies

	- This is an option at UCSD too!

---

### Then I realized I needed to figure out what was going on with that ergative case

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/charlie.png">

---

### Then I realized I needed to figure out what was going on with that ergative case

- I started looking at Grad schools

	- ... and applying

- I got into some of them
	
	- (My application was straight trash.)

---

### Linguistics Grad School

- Phonetics

- Phonology

- Morphology

- Syntax

- Semantics and Pragmatics

- Field Methods

---

### ... and I attended the LSA Summer Institute

- Every two years ([It's at UMass Amherst in Summer 2023!](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/umass-amherst-selected-host-2023-linguistic-institute))

- Take courses from amazing professors in interesting topics

---

### You'll also be put to work

- As a TA or Graduate Instructor

- Working on or managing research projects

- You'll write large papers, alongside your coursework

---

### Then, you'll write a dissertation!

- A large research project where you need to advance the knowledge of the field (just a little!)

- Mine is in progress (help)

---

## Linguistics Jobs

---

### Linguists have one big problem on the job market

- *"Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!  How many languages do you speak?!"*

- Lots of folks need linguists, but very few people know that they do or what we do!

- We're called "Ontologists", "Natural Language Specialists", "Customer Feedback Analyst", "Language specialist", "Translation Director" and many, many more

- Here's [a page from the LSA about Linguistics Jobs](https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/linguistics-profession)

---

### What else do linguists do?

- Check out the [Linguistics Career Launch YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNJRxM5T1SAtgT6Bhcext2Q) 

---

### Linguists often make great data scientists

- Industry loves Linguists, as we're great at patterns

- Linguists have experience with language data, not just numbers

- This is where [the CSS program](https://css.ucsd.edu/) can help!

---

### Industry loves computational linguists

- Text to Speech, Speech Recognition, NLP, and more!

	- Consider LIGN 6, 165, 167, 168 for this

- Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and more hire and work with linguists!

---

### The Department of Defense loves linguists

- The NSA/CIA/FBI (and more!) want linguists for analysis

- Translation and language teaching like at the [DLIFLC](http://www.dliflc.edu/)

---

### Teaching English as a second language

- Everybody wants people to teach English as a Second Language

- Have language, will travel?  Have job!

---

### Speech Pathology and Audiology

- Speech Pathologists help adults and children having issues with communication, speech, swallowing, and voice.

- Audiologists help test, diagnose, and address many hearing disorders, and work with people to find treatments (e.g. hearing aids) which address their needs and desires.

- Both are steady, well-paid, and in demand jobs!

- For these careers, consider our [Speech and Language Sciences Major!](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/undergrad/majors/speech-language/index.html)

---

### Academic Positions

- PostDocs are increasingly common

- Also administrative and lab-management positions

- ... but lots of folks want to be a Tenure-Track Professor

---

### As a Professor...

- You have job security (if you don't screw up!)

- You'll do research

- You'll teach

- You'll do administrative stuff

- You'll fight for grant money

- ... but you'll do all of it in pursuit of a field you love

---

### There's one problem with planning to be a professor...

---

### The Linguistics Academic Job Market

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/hell.jpg">

---

### The Academic Job Market is tough

- There will be 2-5 jobs per year in your subfield at well-known schools.  Total.
	
- Competition is fierce
	
	- Jobs can have 100+ Applicants
	- 10-15 get online interviews
	- 3-5 visit campus
	- 1 job!
	
- You have to love teaching

	- Research-only jobs are very rare
	
- "Wait your turn, you only need one job"

	- ... but boy, that sucks.

---

### It's not an easy path 

- You're going where the work is

	- I hope your people are mobile!

- You need to be able to tread water for a few years

- You're taking a vow of fiscal renunciation during Grad School

	- ... and you'll make more money in industry than as a professor

---
### Your life may not be like mine

- You may choose industry over academia

- You may choose to pursue Linguistics as a component of a different career elsewhere

- You may combine your love of Language with your love of something else

- You may even be able to convince yourself that you're not a linguist

---

### ... but it could be

- Maybe you'll go down the rabbit hole

- Maybe this class will do for you what 101 did for me

- ... and you'll see the true beauty of language

---

### You've come a long way in this class

- ... but one thing is for sure

---

### In the future, you'll all need to do linguistic analysis

- Perhaps as part of your teaching or research, if you decide to go the academic route

- Maybe in industry or defense, if that's your path

- Maybe for fun, on the weekends

	- ... and during the week
	
- You'll want to do it well!

# The Secret to Great Linguistic Analysis

---

### Most linguistics students don't learn this until graduate school

- Many not until a post-doc

- Some, not until they're full professors

- Some poor souls never figure it out!

- **... but you'll know it today!**

---

### We'll end the class like we've lived the class, staring at data!

- *To discover the secret to Great Linguistic Analysis, you'll need to figure out...*

---

### What is the Russian morpheme marking first person (e.g. 'I do _____') for these verbs?
