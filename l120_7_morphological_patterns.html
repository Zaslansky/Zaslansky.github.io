# Common Morphological Patterns
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### Today's Plan

- How do we gloss sentences?

- How do languages vary in how they use morphology?

- What kinds of morphological machinery are common around the world?

---

# Glossing Conventions

---

### Translations often don't give us enough detail

---

### Soy de Denver (Spanish)

- 'I'm from Denver'

---

### Ngelay chadi (Mapuche)

- 'There is no salt'

- <small>Baker, M. (2002). On category asymmetries in derivational morphology. In Morphology 2000. John Benjamins Publishing.</small>

---

### Ka:haÃÅskiyakiÃÅre:reÃÅ îeriwa:ha. (Wichita)

- ‚ÄòOnce upon a time they say there was a big village.‚Äô

- üòÆ

- <small>Rood, D. S. (2002). Polysynthetic word formation. In Morphology 2000. John Benjamins Publishing.</small>
---

### We can do better!

- We can provide detailed glosses which relate the language forms to the translated meaning

- These are called **interlinear glosses**, and (often) follow the Leipzig Glossing Conventions

- [The rules are defined here](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php)

---

### Rough outline of the Leipzig Conventions

- 1) Word-to-word correspondence
  
    - Textual alignment from line to line

- 2) Set grammatical value abbreviations

    - Your book has a great list of them at the beginning

- 3) Separate morphemes within words using hyphens where possible

- 4) Use periods to mark non-separable morphological constituents within a word (when not segmentable)

---

### Soy de Denver (Spanish)

- be.1SG.PRES from Denver

- 'I'm from Denver'

---

### Ngelay chadi (Mapuche)

<img class="wide" src="morphology/mapuche_gloss.jpg">

---

### Ka:haÃÅskiyakiÃÅre:reÃÅ îeriwa:ha. (Wichita)

<img class="wide" src="morphology/wichita_gloss.jpg">

---

### Interlinear Glossing makes things *much* easier for linguists

- It allows quicker understanding of the components and elements of the sentence

    - With just translations, understanding requires analysis

- We see the morphology front-and-center

- This is a bit tricky in typesetting, but it works!

- *Interlinear glossing is a great tool to use in describing data and words!*

---

### One specific element we *need* to see for LIGN 120

- Separate morphemes using '-'

- Separate within-morpheme meanings using '.'

- This is subtle, but *crucial*

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/wichita_gloss.jpg">

---

### Mind you, some languages do more within-word morphology than others...

- Wait, hold on, that feels like a segue!

---

<img class="wide" src="humorimg/segway.jpg">

---

# Do languages differ in how they use morphology?

---

(Yes.)

---

## Morphological Type

A means of categorizing how languages put words together

- This is useful for comparing word-building strategies *across languages*

* ***Do words have lots of morphemes or few?***

---

### Do words have lots of morphemes or few?

* If words have few morphemes (like English or Chinese), they're "isolating" or "analytic"

* If they have many (like Spanish or German), they're "synthetic"

	* Languages where whole sentences are single words are sometimes called "polysynthetic"

---

<lang>English</lang><br><ldata>IE:Germanic - All over</ldata> 
 
I did see the cat on the street, he's cute.

I did see DEF cat on DEF street he-be.3sg cute.

* Only one morpheme in most words! ***This is Isolating!***

---

<lang>Spanish</lang><br><ldata>IE:Italic - All over</ldata> 
 
*Esta escribi√©ndomelo*

be.3sg write-GER-1sg.DAT-3sg.MASC

'He/she is writing it to me.'

* Lots of morphemes per word! ***This is Synthetic!***

---

<lang>Wichita</lang><br><ldata>Caddoan - Oklahoma</ldata>

Kiyakiic√≠wa:c√©:hir îas îirhawi

‚ÄòThere was the big buffalo lying there.‚Äô

* Uh... yeah. ***This is polysynthetic!***

---

## We also care about how easy the morphemes are to pick apart

---

### In a synthetic language, do the morphemes blend together, or are they easy to pick apart?

* If the meanings have individual, easily separable forms, it's "agglutinating"

* If the meanings merge inseparably into opaque forms, it's "fusional".

---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata> 

<img src="lotwimg/agglutinatingturkish.png"> 

* Those add together cleanly, and pick back apart.  We're ***agglutinating***!

---

<lang>German</lang><br><ldata>IE:Germanic - Germany</ldata> 

*Donaudampfschifffahrtselektrizit√§tenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft* 

Donau-dampf-schiff-fahrts-elektrizit√§ten-haupt-betriebs-werk-bau-unter-beamten-gesellschaft

Danube-steam-ship-transport's-electricities-head-operation's-work-building-under-officials-association

* Look at those clean lines!  ***Agglutinative!***

---

<lang>Russian</lang><br><ldata>IE:Slavic - Russian</ldata> 

Ti uhodila so mnoi

Ti u-hodi-la so mnoi

2sg.NOM away-go.IMPERF-past.FEM with 1sg.INST

"You left with me"

* Uh-oh!  Those morphemes mean lots of things!  This is ***Fusional!***

---

<lang>Spanish</lang><br><ldata>IE:Italic - All over</ldata> 

Durmi√©ramos

Durmi√©ramos

Sleep.2pl.SUBJ.PAST.IMPERFECT

* Whoa.  All that is one morpheme?  No easy lines?  ***Fusion*** drives engaged!

---

### It's always a continuum

* English is isolating, but Mandarin is *more* isolating

	* Same with Synthetic: Nobody's besting Wichita, but we don't hold it against them.

* Most languages do *some* fusion and *some* agglutination

	* We call a language fusional or agglutinating when it becomes a habit

---

### Morphological Type - Review!

* If a language has few morphemes per word, it's *isolating*

* If the language has multiple morphemes per word, it's *synthetic*

* If a synthetic language generally has easy-to-pick-apart morphemes, it's *agglutinating*

* If a synthetic language generally has blended or combined morphemes, it's *fusional*

---

... Which gets us into our next question

---

# How are languages marking meaning, anyways?

---

### Two main methods of doing meaning

- Concatenation

- Non-Concatentative Processes

---

## Concatenative Morphology

---

## Concatenation

Combining elements in a strictly linear order, end-to-end

- So, *concatenative morphology* adds morpemes one-after-the-other

    - fish-ing
    
    - in-conceiv-able
    
---

### Common Methods of Concatentative Morphology

- Prefixes

- Suffixes

- Circumfixes

- Infixes

---

### Prefixes

- Precedes the base

- in-conceivable

- u-hodi-t (away-go.IMPERF-INF) 'To go Away' (Russian)

---

### Suffixes

- Follows the base

- cat-s

- u-hodi-la (away-go.IMPERF-PAST.FEM) 'She went away' (Russian)

---

### Infixes

- Placed inside the base

- abso-f\*\*\*ing-lutely

- Alabama Passive infix -l-

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/alabama_infix.jpg">


---

### Circumfixes

- Occur on both sides of the base, but not independently

    - For an affix to be a circumfix, *both sides must be obligatory!*
    
- German ge-X-t past participle (ge-spiel-t, from spielen)
    
- This Papuan Malay circumix ke-X-ang which nominalizes verbs

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/malay_circumfix.jpg">

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### In the Chukchi example below, Comitative forms are marked with a ...

<img class="wide" src="morphology/chukchi_circumfix.jpg">

A) Prefix

B) Suffix

C) Infix

D) Circumfix

---

### Remember, it's not always so easy to pull things apart!

---

### Phonology makes things less clear, sometimes!

- This Begak (Austronesian, Malaysia) infix -i- marking completive aspect

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/begak_infix.jpg">

- The infix is added, then the stem vowel is removed

- Can also neutralize contrasts

---

### Sequences of affixes can make some of them feel infixy

- Un-thought-ful-ness

    - How do we know '-ful' isn't an infix?
    
---

## Aside: Ordering of affixation

---

### Recovering ordering of operation (and thus, meaning) is always tricky!

- Incorrect understanding of the ordering can lead to *morphological ambiguity*

- This appears well handled by hierarchy

- This is why some people create morphological trees, showing the components being modified

---

---

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/mtree_unlockability.jpg">

---

... but are we always adding something on?

---

## Non-Concatenative Morphology

---

### Sometimes, morphological operations *change* words without adding new chunks

- You can't readily disassemble the pieces

- The meaning change is carried by modifications to the other morphemes

- ... or nothing appears to change at all!

---

### Common non-concatenative ways of adding chunks of meaning to words

- Conversion

- Stem Modification

- Reduplication

---

### Conversion

- 'Just change the usage to change the type'

- Sometimes, there are changes with stress shift

    - re'peat (V) -> 'repeat (N)
    
    - con'vict (V) -> 'convict (N)
    
- Sometimes, there are no changes

    - ticket (N, V)
    
    - drink (N, V)

- I computered all day yesterday.

---

### Stem Modification

- *Modify* the stem to indicate a shift in morphological category or meaning

- This can take many forms

---

### Stem Modification - Tone

<img class="wide" src="morphology/dinka_tonepassive.jpg">

- What's the passive morpheme in Dinka?

---

### Stem Modification - Vowel Modification ('Ablaut')

<img class="wide" src="morphology/zway_ablaut.jpg">

- What's the 2SGF morpheme in Zway?

- Also, sing/sang

---

### Stem Modification - Consonant Changes

<img class="wide" src="morphology/chaha_palatalization.jpg">

- What's the 2SGF morpheme in Zway?

---

### Stem Modification - Other Processes

- Labialization
- Vowel Fronting/Backing/Rounding/ATR Changes
- Voicing Changes
- Lenition or Fortition
- Gemination or Lengthening
- Shortening
- Segment deletion
- Metathesis (swapping segments around)

---

### Reduplication

- Copying all or part of the base

- <img src="morphology/warlpiri_redup.jpg">

- A big, BIG problem if you're expecting different segments

---

### ... but in all of these cases, nothing's added, just changed!

---

### Wrapping Up

- Using reasonable glossing conventions makes life easier for everybody

- Languages have more or fewer morphemes per word, and meanings separate more or less cleanly

- Meaning can be expressed by concatening chunks of form in various ways

- ... or by modifying the base in predictable and detectable ways

- Be prepared for all kinds of craziness when dealing with actual language data!

---

## For Next Time

- We'll have more data to work with!
