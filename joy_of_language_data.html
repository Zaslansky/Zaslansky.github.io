## The Joy (and pain) of Natural Language Processing
### Will Styler - LING 2000

---

## Today's Talk:

* ### Part 1: Why we *badly* want to use natural language processing.  

* ### Part 2: Why natural language processing is *really* hard. 

---

# Part 1

## Why you *badly* want to use natural langauge data.

---

## There's a *lot* of natural language data out there.

* 644 million active websites <small>(<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-web-sites-are-are-there-2012-3">Source</a>)</small>

* Mayo Clinic enters 298 million patient records per year <small>(<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/emr/">Source</a>)</small>

* 58 million Tweets per day <small>(<a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/twitter-statistics/">Source</a>)</small>

* 294 billion emails sent daily <small>([Source](http://email.about.com/od/emailtrivia/f/emails_per_day.htm))</small>

* Recorded phone calls, blog posts, Facebook updates...

* ... and that's just the digital stuff

---

## The Problem:

Humans are inefficient and expensive.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### So let's enjoy a fantasy...

---

You have a computer which understands human language as well as it does computer language

### (minus the evil)

---

## What could analysis of natural language data do for you?

---

## Speech Recognition

"Ask people why they're calling, and connect them to the right department based on their answer."   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Flag all tech support conversations where the customer mentions a competitor"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"Be Siri, but good."   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Analysis of secondary speech characteristics

"Redirect all angry-sounding customers to higher-tier support workers" (Speech emotion detection) <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Are the two people in this skype call flirting, arguing, expressing love, or sadness?  Target post-session ads accordingly."    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"I want to talk to... billing?" (Uncertainty analysis)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Yeah, I really like going to Applebees." (Spot-the-sarcasm)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Data Aggregation

“Watch Twitter and give me the locations of wildfires, floods, etc, and provide information about damage, shelters and resources in an easy-to-read format” (EPIC) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“Read every news article about the Ukrainian Revolution and present the information on a cohesive timeline, with sources labeled.” (RED) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“Collect all case-law involving reverse mortgages in the state of Florida in which the plaintiff's children filed suit against the mortgage company”
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Authorship attribution and stylistic analysis

“Examine these two written passages/books and tell me whether they were both written by the same person” (Authorship Attribution Analysis)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Examine these negative reviews and tell me what demographic the authors likely represent based on the language used." <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Are these critical forum posts written by the same person?"  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Predictive analysis of text

“Look for any information in the newswire which will predict a change in this company's stock price, then buy or sell stock automatically.” <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“Based on this person's Facebook post history, how likely is she to click an ad for weight-loss pills?” <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

"Based on all the political posts and tweets in Westminster compared to those in Pueblo, how likely is this senator to lose in a recall election?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Sentiment Analysis

---
### A Case Study

Advertisers want their ads to be relevant   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

They want to show ads related to topics and products people enjoy.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Using these principles, Facebook is trolling Will.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## The easy approach

Keywords == Mentions, Mentions == Interest   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"Scan each Facebook post for certain keywords.  If they appear, show ads for related products and topics."   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### How Facebook reads Will's Facebook Posts

"blah blah blah blah blah ***marijuana***, blah blah blahbity blah blah blah" 

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"blahbity blahblah, ***pot***, blah blah blah blah blah ***Amendment 64*** blahbity blah blah blah"  

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Facebook's choice in Ads for Will

---

---

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/potdomains.png"> 

---

One tiny problem...

### Marijuana smoke makes Will's throat swell shut.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Will's actual Facebook Posts

"Ugh, my neighbor is smoking ***marijuana*** on his deck again, time to bust out the gas mask."   

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"I'm really tired of ***pot*** in public. Even after ***Amendment 64***, I still can't go to a concert without risking death."  

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Facebook's advertisers are getting ripped off

Presenting topical ads to people who hate those topics is a waste of money   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

This is easily preventable.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### How could we solve this problem?

---

## Sentiment Analysis

“How often, in this corpus of blogs, do people say nice or awful things about product X?”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"We've just leaked a picture of our next supercar.  How do people on twitter like the design?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"What are people saying about our leaked $199.99 pricepoint?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"How do people on these forums feel about 9/11?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Temporal Analysis and Event Discovery

---

### A Case Study

Many hospitals around the country are switching to Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

These records are easily available within the institution, and contain lots of valuable data.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Creating timelines is incredibly time-consuming for humans, as is comparison.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

What if machines could do this for us?   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

[The THYME Project](https://clear.colorado.edu/TemporalWiki/index.php/Main_Page)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Sequence of events:

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 1) Surgery

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 2) Mild rash

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 3) Hydrocortisone, Followup (overlapping)

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 4) No more rash

---


### If a computer can be taught to interpret time in medical records, we can ask...

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> "I have 30 seconds to learn this patient's history.  Go."

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “How often do patients have heart attacks within 2 years of starting Vioxx?”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “How many people who have a facelift develop persistent facial numbness?”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
“How long do patients usually live following diagnosis of Glioblastoma?”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
“Is there a correlation between the administration of vaccines and the development of autism?” 

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 	**[(No, damnit.)](http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110105/bmj-wakefield-autism-faq?print=true)**  


---

### Temporal reasoning is important

Humans interpret time naturally, and make reference to it often.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Temporality interacts with causality in interesting ways.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

Event detection and reasoning is useful in a variety of domains. <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"What happened" is a very fundamental question that everybody wants answered.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Analysis as a service

“Given this large sample of a child’s speech, is the child likely to be autistic?” (Current research at the LENA foundation in Boulder) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

"Scan online white-supremacist forums for anything which looks like a threat against the President" (The US Secret Service)  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“Watch these websites being used by islamist groups and look for specific language usage patterns that predict violent and radical behavior.” (All sorts of defense department grants) 				<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“Read every email, looking for threats or discussion of terrorist attacks on American soil.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## What questions could natural language data answer for you?

* Any questions that a human reading it could answer!

---



<img width="1024" src="img/terminator.png">

---

### ... not so fast

---


# Part 2

## Why natural language data is really difficult to use.

---

<img width="100%" src="img/temptation.jpg">

---

# No.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

<img class="big" src="img/hal9000.jpg"> 

### Not yours.   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## NLP - Natural Language Processing
Teaching computers to “understand” human language

---

Ghazaleh talked about the process already.

* We're going to look at a different question

* ### Why is this so hard?

---

# Natural Language is difficult at every level  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Speech

Speech is a convenient cover for widespread telepathy.

([CITATION NEEDED])   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### You understand me right now

---

<img class="big" src="img/magic.jpg">

---

### No two people sound alike, even saying the same things

---

### The right answer depends on the context.  

---

"Bring me the bat, man"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/dugout.jpg"> 

---

"Bring me the Batman"

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/joker.jpg"> 

---

### Speech recognition is spectacularly good, but nowhere near good enough.

---

## Modality

Did something happen?  Is it real?

---

### Modality is difficult 

"The compound might be bombed"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"If they attack, we'll bomb the compound."   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“The general stated that bombing the compound overnight “was still an option””   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“We may conduct a bombing at 0300”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“We will conduct a bombing at 0300”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“We conducted a bombing at 0300”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Coreference/Anaphora

Linking subsequent mentions of items and concepts to one another.

---

### Coreference is difficult

“The Bay Harbor Butcher is off the streets, as Dexter Morgan, the alleged killer, was arrested by police over the weekend”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

““Bill Clinton was the President of the United States in 1999.  Now Barack Obama is POTUS.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Metonymy

Using a word to refer to a practically or metaphorically related concept

---

### Metonymy is difficult


"The terrorist built a **pipe bomb**"

"The __pipe bomb__ interrupted the festival"

  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"**200mg of Loperamide** stopped her diarrhea"

  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

"**Moscow** condemned the latest round of sanctions"

<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Causality

Did one event trigger or cause the next event?

---

### Causality is difficult

“The dam burst when the rockslide hit it.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“The over-full dam burst when the rockslide hit it.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“She pulled the trigger, firing the gun and killing the man.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

“She pulled the trigger, releasing the hammer, igniting the powder charge, launching the bullet and killing the man.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Temporal Expression Normalization

The process of linking relative dates to absolute, calendar dates

---

### Temporal Expressions can be difficult

“The bombing occurred 2/13/12 at 0214”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“Next Tuesday, she’ll come in for a follow-up”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“She’s been having trouble sleeping lately.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“She should expect soreness postoperatively.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“TSA regulations have grown increasingly restrictive Post-9/11”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Temporal Relations

Linking and arranging different events as part of a greater timeline

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up.”

---

### “The patient developed a mild post-surgical rash, which was treated with hydrocortisone at the follow-up, many years after Napoleon's exile to Elba.”

<img class="big" src="naturallanguagedataimg/napoleonhydro.png">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Every event in the history of the universe is temporally related to every other event in this history of the universe.

NumRelations = (NumEvents)*(NumEvents)   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

100 Events == 10,000 valid Temporal Relations   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

# There's often too little information

---

<img width="100%" src="img/vagueness.jpg">


---

## Doctors hate us.

“We biopsied the colon, the results were negative”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“Noted postoperative scarring.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“She does not want a colonoscopy, which she had in the 70’s and did not enjoy.”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“History of Pneumonia, Asthma, h/x diverticulitis, MS”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“s/p lap appy conv. open, Lungs c/ausc, A&Ox3”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

“Resected Invasive Grade 3 of 4 Adenocarcinoma (AJCC 7th PT4N1bMX).”   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

# Everybody else does, too!

"Gold covered the miner's hands"/"Gold paid for the miner's education"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “The Queen of England’s hat was purple”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
“We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were ripe”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 
“We gave the monkeys the bananas because they were hungry”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana”

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> “The old man returned to his house was happy”

---

<img width="1024" src="img/terminator.png">

---

# Not yet.

---

<img width="900" src="img/morpheus.png">
## Hooray!	

---

# The joy of natural language data

---

## Everybody wants this data

* "What are people saying about the world?"

* "What do people want?"

* "What's happening in the world right now?"

* "How can we provide better service?"

* "How can we save time by letting machines do the work?"

---

## ... but natural language doesn't want to give it up

* Speech is crazy-complex

* Meaning is person-specific, and very strange
				
* The meaning and linguistic phenomena in speech are tricky

* You never have enough information

---


## You and language data can have a happy, loving relationship

* All you need to do is ask lots of questions, pay attention to what your data tells you, and always think carefully about what you’re asking it.

* ... but remember, it's not going to make your life easy
