# The problem is with speech recognition

### Will Styler - LIGN 6

---

### First an important program note

- Jewelry of text in today's presentation is the unedited output of Apple speech recognition

	- <correct> "The majority of text..." </correct>

- God help us all

---

### today's plan

- detecting speech is hard

- Noise

- Homophones

- Vocabulary and limited training data

- Variability in Speech

- Speaker variability

---

## Detecting speech is hard

---

> Yoshihisa Ishikawa's one-night stay at a robot-staffed hotel in western Japan wasn't relaxing.  He was roused every few hours during the night by the doll-shaped assistant in his room asking: "Sorry, I couldn't catch that. Could you repeat your request?"  By 6 am, he realized the problem: His heavy snoring was triggering the robot.

---

## Noise

---

### Noise

- Speech tools are expected to work anywhere

- Headphones

- Traffic

- MusicPlaying in the background

---

### Tools for Defeating noise

- Many tools are used

- A raise of multiple microphonesTo localize sound

- Amplitude detectionTo identifyThe target speaker

- Filtering to removeEchoes and background noise

- Deep learning systems design to enhance speech

- [See this paper from Apple on the topic](https://machinelearning.apple.com/2018/12/03/optimizing-siri-on-homepod-in-far-field-settings.html)

---

### Not all noises equal

- It's easier to removeI Squealed in ago

	- <correct>It's easier to remove a squeal than a goat</correct>

- Multiple close talkers present major problems

- I am putting noise can always win

	- <correct>"High amplitude noise can always win"</correct>
	   
---

### Noise removal is an boring problem

- Common to many sound tasks

- The crucial to making a working system

---

## Homophones

---

## Homophones

Two words which are spelled differently, with different meanings, and the same sounds

---

### Example homophones

<correct>For this slide, I cheated with the keyboard</correct>

- then/than

- their/there/they're

- Will/we'll

- Genes/Jeans

- Lift/Lyft

- Outtie/Audi

- Lie/Lye

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/sofa_king.jpg">

---

### On the phones present a major problem for speech recognition

- Humans use meaning to disambiguate

	- He stole a walk from the Chinese restaurant
	
	- He live forever, it must be good genes

	- Use lie to make so
	
	- <correct>"He used lye to make soap"

- Without knowledge of the world, ASR systems can't cheat

---

### Dealing with homophones

- Probability models

	- Will get into these laterIn the quarter

	- QuoteWhat's the probabilityOf this word, given the other oneQuote
	
	- ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Domain specific knowledge

	- How likely is this person to talk about jeansVersus jeans

	- Medical versus versus legal vs. general purpose dictation

---

### This is a problem that might need a IAI

- There're a number of bees in speech recognition

---

## Vocabulary And limited training data

---

### There are many more words than we can train for

- Some estimate the number of words80 speakers no between 25 and 30,000

- Much larger in specific domains

	- E.g. medical or legal language
	
- Names and foreign borrowingsAdd additionalComplexity

---

### Testing Vocabulary

- Bill frequency Castrol coefficient (<correct>MFCC</correct>)

- Dyshidrotic eczema

- proof seven and presumption great hearing 

	- <correct>"Proof Evident, Presumption Great Hearing"</correct>

- Adenocarcinoma arising into pavilions at know

	- <correct>Adenocarcinoma arising in tubovillious adenoma</correct>
	
- "The wallet that says badass motherfucker on it"

- The Dalai Lama,Fidel Castro,Barack Obama,Zygmunt Fry Singer,Yelling at people can bitch,Gabriella Italian

	- <correct>"The Dalai Lama, Fidel Castro, Barack Obama, Zygmunt Frajzyngier, Jelena Krivokapic, Gabriella Caballero"</correct>

---

### Names are very hard

> "... again, this is Melinda Night, calling for a reference check for Eliza colonoscopy"

- Siri did not understand 'Eliza Kolmanovsky'

	- Whoops!
	
---

### Methods of coping with vocabulary issues

- Packaging your product for specific domains

- Mining existing data from the customer

- IntegratingAddress book information for name recognition

- Fuzzy searching usingA list of possibilities

---

## Speech Variability

---

### Even for a single person,Speech berries

- Changes in tempo

- Changes in volume

- Changes in pitch

- Changes in dialect

- Changes in degree of articulation

---

## Hyperarticulation

Producing speech With an unusually Hi clarity and articulation

---

## Hypo articulation

Producing speech with minimal effort And a minimally distinct gestures

---

###  your training data dictates the kind of speech you can recognize

- if you trained only on conversational casual data you're only effective there

- if you train on people reading books aloud in a sound booth, that's what you'll be best at

- you need to choose training data that reflects the task well

---

### Pitch Differences

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/pitch_myname.jpg">

---

### You sound different at 2 AMThen in class

- ASR needs to accommodateTo all states of your voice

- You can't learn to specificallyWhat you Soundlike

---

## Speaker variability

---

### People differ substantially in terms of their speech

- Differences in pitch

- Differences in dialect

- Differences inLanguage background

- Differences in vocal track size and anatomy

	- <correct>Tract, damnit</correct>
	
---

## CaseStudyVal perception

---

<correct> This next section is copied in from another presentation, so no speech-rec errors</correct>

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/vowelformants.gif">

<small>Different American English vowels, as spoken by a male speaker</small>  

---

### Vowel formants are reflections of articulations

- They vary depending on the tongue's position

	- ... as well as the size and shape of the talker's head

- *Different formants from the same speaker mean different vowels*

	- ... kind of

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_speakeraverages.png"> 

---

## But it's even worse than it seems...

---

### Moment-to-moment Vowel Variation

* Even the same speaker will have variation from moment to moment

* Sometimes we misarticulate, accidentally making the wrong vowel quality

	* Or we talk with food in our mouths, producing different resonances

	* Or sometimes, we‚Äôre just plain lazy

* This leads to constant and massive changes in vowel production

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_alltokens.png"> 

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/trainwreck.png">

---

### Every person you've ever talked with has had different vowel formant patterns

* ... and yet, we understand each other, somehow

---

### How do we accomplish this perceptual magic?

---

### Dealing with vowel variability

* We stack the deck in our favor in the grammar of the language

* We use non-formant-related cues such as vowel length

* We adjust to individual speakers (or vocal tracts) through Speaker Normalization

	- We don't yet understand how this works

* We attend to context

---

## Context helps!

---

### The Role of Context

* Context helps us to understand words even if the phonemes are acoustically ambiguous

* Easier to understand ‚ÄúHello‚Äù in its normal conversational context

* If you‚Äôre not expecting a word, you‚Äôll have to fight harder to understand it.

	* ‚ÄúHi, John!  Partial Nephrectomy!‚Äù

	* ‚ÄúOhh, Invasive Adenocarcinoma arising in tubulovillious adenoma‚Äù

* Nobody runs into rooms and shouts "bat!"

---

<correct>Back to ASR-based lecture-writing. Nooooooo. </correct>

---

### ASR systems perform normalization

- Sometimes it's explicitParenthesisQuoteFirst, read this paragraph for meQuote parenthesis

- Sometimes assumptions are made on the basis of the pitchAnd other than domestic factors

- Sometimes it emerges from the data

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/clearspeech_alltokens.png"> 

---

### Sometimes it can be avoided

English vowels different duration

Context can be very very helpful

The more you can predict what is being said,The better

---

### ChildrenAre extra awful

- Incredibly high pitches

- Small vocal tracks

- PoorSpeech abilitiesComparatively

- Just bad communicators in general

- Yet we expect a laxative work just fine

	- <correct>"Yet we expect Alexa to work just fine"</correct>

---

### Speaker variability is the biggest problem that ASR faces

Every single user sounds different,But expect the same results

This is absolutely amazing,And terrifying

---

### Wrapping up

- Speech recognition is really hard

- There are many sources of noise, and ways to deal with it

- Homophones cause amazingAnd terrible problems

- Your system is only as good as its vocabulary

- Speech is very variable within speakers

- Speech varies across speakers as well
