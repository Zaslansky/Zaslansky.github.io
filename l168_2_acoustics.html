# Acoustics

### Will Styler - LIGN 168

---

### Today's Plan

- What is sound?

- What are the properties of sound?

- Complex Sounds

---

### Sound is compression and rarefaction in a medium

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

---

### ... but we need to talk about it more concretely!

---

### The Key Properties of Sound

- Duration

	- How long does it last?
	
- Amplitude

	- How powerful is it?
	
- Frequency

	- How often does it cycle?
	
- Period

	- How long does a single cycle take?

---

### Key Properties Continued
	
- Wavelength

	- How far can the wave travel in a single cycle?
	
- Phase

	- Where in the sound's 'cycle' does it start

---

### Duration 

- We talk about sounds in Milliseconds

	- 1 second (s) = 1000 milliseconds (ms)
	
	- Half a second (0.5 s) = 500 milliseconds (ms)
	
	- One Quarter second (0.25 s) = 250 ms
	
	- 1 meter = 1000 millimeters
	
- Duration is one of the most robust cues in speech!
	- Differences in duration survive most anything

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

### Amplitude

- What is the difference in pressure between compressions and rarefactions?

	- This is related to perceived 'loudness'

- Amplitude isn't interesting this quarter (we'll just assume 'enough')

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200HzHigherAmplitude.jpg">

---

### Conceptualizing Amplitude

- Why is dropping a small book quieter than dropping a large one?

- Why can high amplitude sound be damaging and shatter windows?

---

### Period

- How long does a single cycle last?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.005 seconds (5 ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/200Hz.wav"></audio>


---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.0025 seconds (2.5ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/400Hz.wav"></audio>


---

### Frequency

- "How many times does the sound cycle in one second?"

- Measured in 'Hertz' (Hz), also known as 'Cycles per second'

- 'How many periods can fit in one second?'

---

# f = 1/t

- f = Frequency in Hz
- t = Period in Seconds

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.005 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.005 = **200 Hz**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**

---

### Greater period = Lower Frequency!

- Longer cycles == Fewer Cycles per Second

---

### Frequency is related to pitch and wavelength

- Pitch is the perceptual correlate of frequency

	- Generally, when frequency goes up, so does perceived pitch

- Lower frequency waves travel farther per cycle
	- They have longer 'wavelength'
	- Wavelength isn't very interesting for LIGN 168

---

### We can find these things out for any sound!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

- Amplitude ≈ 0.9
- Duration = ??
- Period = 0.01 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.01 = 100 Hz
- Wavelength = 343/100 = 3.43 meters

---

### How do we create complex sounds?

- By making multiple sounds at the same time!

- Or, mathematically, using addition!

---

### Let's look at this process in a bit more detail!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_2x_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_3x_90_separate.jpg">

---

### You can add very different frequencies!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### Why would sounds be combined together using addition?

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### The sum of two waves is the sum of their pressures at any given point

- Which gives rise to...

---

## Interference

---

### Interference

- Multiple signals are 'interfering' with one another when they collide and affect one another

- *Affect* means just that!  Any effect at all!

- There are two main kinds of interference in audio

	- Constructive Interference

	- Destructive Interference

---

### Constructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **stronger**

- When peaks add together with peaks

---

### Destructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **weaker**

- When peaks add together with valleys

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### ... but wait

- Those sounds had the same frequency

- The same amplitude

- ... and the same duration

- One pair combined constructively, and the other pair destructively

- ### What's the difference?

---

## Phase

---

### Phase

- The point of the cycle in which a sound 'starts'

- The 'orientation' of the wave in time

- We measure phase in Degrees (°)

	- 0° is the base, and is the same as 360°

	- 180° is the exact opposite phase from 0°

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_phases_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase is important for adding sounds together!

- Sounds that are 'in phase' experience constructive interference

- Sounds that are 'out of phase' experience destructive interference

    - Also called 'phase cancellation' here

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference/Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### Complete cancellation is relatively rare!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_amplified_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase effects aren't all-or-nothing

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_offbad_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_off_separate.jpg">

---

### Aside: Applied Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/noise_cancelling_headphones.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/muffler.jpg">

---

### Humans can't detect phase

- It doesn't matter what phase a sound starts on to us

- But it's crucial when making complex sounds!

---

### Subtle Phase differences matter!

---

## Speech Signals are wildly complicated

---

### Speech has one 'fundamental frequency'

- This comes from your larynx

- The 'Pitch' of your voice, called 'f0' or the Fundamental Frequency

- Then it has many 'harmonics' which are waves which are multiples of f0

---

### We then 'filter' that through our vocal tract

- The Fundamental and harmonics pass through your vocal tract and the resonances are shaped by tongue shape and more

- What you do with your larynx is **independent** of what happens to that signal in the rest of the vocal tract

- We talk about the 'Source-Filter Model' to capture this

---

### Even a steady vowel is complex

### Even a steady vowel is complex

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/waveform_i.png'>

---

### Even a steady vowel is complex

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/waveform_uh.png'>

---

### So is a nasal

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/waveform_n.png'>

---

### Other speech sounds make their own, aperiodic noise

- Fricatives produce separate noise by creating turbulence in air

- Stops and Ejectives produce 'bursts' of noise on release

- Clicks release vacuum to produce sound

---

### Aperiodic Sounds

- Do not have a fundamental frequency

	- Measuring the period/frequency/wavelength isn't helpful or meaningful

- They are best modeled with gaussian noise rather than tones

- They will need to be processed and treated differently than periodic sounds

---

### Frication Noise is aperiodic

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/waveform_s.png'>

---

### So are stop releases

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/waveform_k.png'>

---

### All this adds up to very complex waves

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/sky.png'>

---

### All this adds up to very complex waves

<img class='r-stretch' src='phonmedia/noisewaveform.png'>

---

### ... So how do we capture these complex waves with a computer which understands only 0 and 1?

- *Next time!*

---

### Wrapping Up

- All sounds have amplitude, duration, periods, frequencies, wavelengths, and phases

- Many of these things are related to one another

- These properties have real consequences for how sound actually works!
