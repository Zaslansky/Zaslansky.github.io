### Administrative Notes

- My Friday Office Hours are cancelled

    - But I'll have an extra hour today, after class

    - I won't be able to respond to emails over the weekend

- Amber will give a guest talk Friday

    - Clickers will be used!

- Clicker scores will be finalized early next week along with SONA

    - If I've asked you to remind me to change anything, now's the time

- Graduating seniors, come see me after class!

---

### Grades

- There's a good chance that I'll be doing a bit of curving (by HW or overall)

- Don't be too disheartened if your current grade is feeling low

    - Bad grades will still be possible, but I want good students to get good grades

- The goal of difficult assignments is to challenge you, not destroy you

---

### Homework 4 is due Friday

- **You'll need to work alone on this**

---

### Please fill out your CAPE evaluations

- It makes a difference, for me and future students

- Be honest, but also be fair

---


### Today's Plan

- What more awaits you in Morphology

- What we have learned

- The secret to great linguistic analysis

---

# The Morphology we missed

---

### Quarters are short

- There's always a balancing act

    - "If I focus on this, I'll lose that"

    - "... but I want to talk about case!"

- More time with data is good

    - ... but takes away time for theory
    
- Morphology is so broad in interactions that you can't cover it all!

---

### There remain many topics for you in morphology!

- (We had to save something for grad school, right?)

- So, I'll give a sneak preview of some of the things we've missed

---

## Compositionality

---

### Compositionality

- "Every complex expression can be exhaustively broken down into minimally meaningful pieces, with no units of form or meaning left unaccounted for”

- Are there meanings that are 'unaccounted for'?

- Are there words which have more forms than meanings?

- Are there words which have more meanings than forms?

- Are there words whose meaning cannot be predicted from the forms?

---

### Nahuatl to the rescuetl

<img class="wide" src="morphology/nahuatlnoncomp.jpg">

---

### It sure seems like there's non-compositional meaning!

- 'Drink-water' becomes 'drown'

    - ... but only when incorporated!

- 'Flower-make' becomes 'arrange flowers'

    - ... but only when incorporated!

- 'deer-flee' becomes 'skittishly and quickly run away'

---

### "... but maybe those are just morphemes with different meanings!"

- Well, OK, but how about...

---

## Phonaesthemes

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### "Would you like to buy a new Glimp?  It..."

a) Sharpens knives.

b) Lights up your house.

c) Tastes good.

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### "Damnit, I left my meb in the car!"

a) I won't be able to sew as well.

b) I'll be unable to fill my bird feeders

c) What if there's a fire?!

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>


### "Have you seen my snofter?..."

a) My nose is sore.

b) I dropped a glass.

c) It's cold in here.

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### "I got diabetes.  It must be from drinking all that..."

b) Mabler cola

c) Wika cola

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### "You Mom is plafty."

a) "Them's fighting words."

b) "Maybe?"

c) "Thanks!"

---

<section data-background-color=#708cef></section>

### "Your Mom is slafty."

a) "Them's fighting words."

b) "Maybe?"

c) "Thanks!"

## Phonaesthemes

"Frequently recurring sound-meaning pairings that are not clearly contrastive morphemes"

- First defined by Ben Bergen ([Bergen 2004](http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/language/v080/80.2bergen.pdf)), who is at UCSD!

---

## Ben Bergen

<img class="tall" src="img/people_benbergen.jpg">

---

### Phonaesthemes in English

- gl- ‘light, vision’ *glimmer, glisten, glitter, gleam, glow, glint*, etc.

- sn- ‘nose, mouth’ *snore, snack, snout, snarl, snort, sniff, sneeze*, etc.

- sl - 'pejorative', *slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth*, etc.

- b_l - 'expand abnormally', *blimp, bulge, bulk, balloon, blip*   

---

### These are clearly not morphemes

- In fact, they're part of other morphemes (e.g. "snack")

    - ... but they sure carry meaning!

- These *emerged* as statistical accidents in the lexicon

    - "Lots of GL words mean light, so GL must mean light!"
    
- They do end up seeming 'real' to speakers!

- Neat!

---

- Speaking of things that aren't morphemes...

---

## Lessthemes

---

### Nah, that's not really a thing.

- ...but for half a second, you all were reanalyzing 'morpheme' pretty hard

- <img class="wide" src="humorimg/evillaugh.gif">

---

Instead, let's check out...

---

## Multi-Word Expressions

---

### We talked about compounds

- "Bleu Cheese Salad Dressing"

- "Laptop"

- "Deer-Flee"

- "Inflectional Morphology"

---

### Compounds are continuous chunks!

- "I'm going to Bleu Cheese the heck out of this Salad Dressing" is not a compound use

    - Although "blue cheese" and "salad dressing" may still be

---

### There are other 'words' which are discontinuous

- "I threw my lunch up on the roof"

- "I threw up my lunch on the roof"

- "We're going to cut Mary out of the agreement"

- "We're going to cut out Mary from the agreement"

---

### These verb-particle constructions feel like words in many ways

- "Hit up" != "Hit"

- "Throw out/up/in/back"

- "Cut up/across/down/out/in/with"

- They're separable, though

    - ... and comprised of multiple parts

- These are super difficult for computers to handle

---

### Speaking of which...

---

## Computational Morphology

---

### Morphology complicates natural language processing

- We need some way to teach Siri that 'walks' and 'walk' and 'walking' and 'walker' and 'walked' are the same

- "I saw Cardi B's dog walk to the store" and "I saw Cardi B dog walk Tomi Lahren"

- "Siri, remind me to hit Jamie up"

    - "OK, I'll remind you to hit Jamie."

- "User has entered a word "swash".  What's the plural of it?"

---

### Quantitative Research into Morphology is crucial

- How can we solve morphological problems by language modeling

- How can we use large amounts of data predict to morphological behavior?

- What can huge corpora teach us about usage?

- How does machine learning help us understand human learning?

---

### The interface between morphology, learning, and computer work will be Friday

- Amber's got a great talk planned

- Be there, or be super lame

- Speaking of interfaces...

---

## Interfaces

---

### Morphology connects to everything!

- Phonetics can be affected by lexical considerations

- Morphophonology is 100% a thing

- Morphology and Syntax interact at many levels

- Semantics is the meaning half of form and meaning

- Pragmatics is crucial for context and contrast

---

### There's much more waiting for you in Morphology!

- That's why it's called 'More-phology!'

- <img class="wide" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">

---

# Looking back at this quarter

---

### What did you learn about...

- Morphological Analysis?

- Morphological patterns?

- What 'word' means?

- How words might be created?

- About the lexicon?

---

### You've learned a lot!

- You can now solve morphological problems with elegance, generality, realism, and a minimum of complexity

- You know how morphology works, around the world!

- You know some ways of dealing with weirdly shaped 'words' and affixes!

- You've got a good sense of ways too think about word creation and productivity!

- You know the big questions about the lexicon, and a few different answers!

---

### We've also had some big discussions about the nature of language

- Should we describe language through parts and rules, which *generate* the proper forms?

- Should we describe language by looking at the *usage*, and the make generalizations as needed?

- Should we take the middle path, and say that grammar may emerge, but the patterns are real, too?

- Which of these is cognitively real?

    - ... does it even matter?

---

### ... and you learned some valuable life lessons

- A good analysis isn't good if you can't understand it

- Don't assume that anything must be (or mustn't be) marked

- Don't assume that 'salt' isn't secretly a verb.

- Don't assume that a new language will work like you're used to

- Don't open a beer with a chainsaw, just because you can.

- **The past tense of 'yeet' is 'yote', and the participle is 'yaughten'**

---

### I know what you're thinking...

- "Wow, all that amazing knowledge, in just 10 weeks?"

- **"What more could we possibly ask for?"**

---

# The secret to great linguistic analysis

---

### You've come a long way in the program

- LIGN 101, 110, 111

- Many of you have taken syntax and semantics

- Some of you are about to graduate!

---

### In the future, you'll all need to do linguistic analysis

- Perhaps as part of your teaching or research, if you decide to go the academic route

- Maybe in industry or defense, if that's your path

- Maybe for fun, on the weekends

    - ... and during the week

---

## You'll want to do *great* linguistic analysis

- So, I'm going to finally tell you the secret

---

### Most linguistics students don't learn this until graduate school

- Many not until a post-doc

- Some, not until they're full professors

- Some poor souls never figure it out!

- **... but you'll know it today!**

---

### We'll end the class like we've lived the class, staring at data!

- *To discover the secret to Great Linguistic Analysis, you'll need to figure out...*

---

### What is the Russian marker for 1SG.PRES for these verbs?

## That's the secret, right there

- That morpheme

- As you go forward in your linguistic career, remember that...

---

# The Secret to Great Linguistic Analysis was /ju/ all along!
