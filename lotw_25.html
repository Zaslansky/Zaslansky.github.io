# The Circle of Linguistic Life
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### Today's Agenda

* Why do languages die?

* How do we save them?

---

# Language Death

---

### Language Death

* Different people define it differently

	* Last speaker dies?

	* Second-to-last?

	* [The last two speakers hate each other](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/13/mexico-language-ayapaneco-dying-out)?
	
	* Only one fluent speaker?
	
* ... but it definitely happens

---

### How often?

* According to [The Endangered Languages project](http://www.endangeredlanguages.com), around 46% of languages are currently "endangered"

* "9.2% of the living languages have fewer than 10 speakers and are very likely to die out soon, if no revitalization efforts are made."

* "639 of the languages known to have existed are already extinct â€“ 10% of all languages."

* "Since 1960 we have lost as many as 28 entire language families."

* "Language death progresses at the rate of about one language in three months"

---

# Why do languages die?

---

First, let's knock out some myths...

---

### "These languages are primitive and incomplete"

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/sealiestthing.jpg"> 

---

### "These languages are primitive and incomplete"

* Incomplete languages don't survive
	* "Mother-in-law languages" and Pidgins are the exception

* Children will "complete" any language given to them
	* Solange will talk about this Wednesday

* You're primitive!
---

### "These languages can't express modern concepts"

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/batmanslap.jpg">

---

### "These languages can't express modern concepts"

* Of course they can.

* English couldn't express "unfriend" 10 years ago, but we found a way

* However: "Speakers *don't use this language* to express modern concepts" happens
	
	* Why add 800 words to your language when the *lingua franca* already has them?

---

### "Every group wants to preserve their language!"

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/idisapprove.jpg">

---

### "Every group wants to preserve their language!"

* Some groups are no longer able or willing to

	* See [Maidu](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29804445)

* Some groups just don't want outsiders to preserve their language

* Some people would really rather just join the larger group

---

### "Every language *must* be saved!"

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/unamused_dog.jpg">

---

### "Every language *must* be saved!"

* We shouldn't have a "linguistic savior" complex

* Groups have a right to do with their languages what they please

* Remember, "all languages must be preserved" *is* a cultural value

	* ... And it's not necessarily shared
 
---

### So why do languages *actually* die?

* Sudden or Biological Language Death

* Top-down language death

* Bottom-up language death

---

### Sudden Language Death

When a language dies because all speakers are killed or isolated

---

### Causes of Sudden Language Death

* All the speakers are wiped out by a disease/flood/plane crash

* All speakers are killed in a Genocide 

	* (see the [Akuntsu](http://www.survivalinternational.org/tribes/akuntsu))

* All speakers are abruptly separated

	* Think diaspora, or refugee crisis

---

### Top-down Language Death

When a language dies due to purposeful efforts by an external group, usually a government or occupying force

---

### Causes of Top-down Language Death

* "All speakers of ______ are enemy combatants/spies/communists"

* "Speaking _______ is illegal"

* "Kidnap indigenous children, given them new names, then raise them in English-only boarding schools!"

	* [The US Government did that](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_boarding_schools)
	
* "It's against the law to provide translation into _______ in courtrooms, hospitals, etc"

* "Children are to be taught in _____ only"

* "You can't teach math in your savage language!"
	
---

### Bottom-up Language Death

When a language dies because the speakers stop using it, or stop teaching it to their children

* *This is the most common cause of language death*

---

### Causes of Bottom-up Language Death

* Minority languages in mostly-monolingual cultures face massive pressures

	* "We're surrounded by speakers of English, why would I want to teach my kids Arapaho?"
	
	* "All business with outsiders is done in English, and they've got all the money..."
	
* "We don't have materials to run schools in our language"

* "We can't write in our language, it's not worth making a new system"

* "Why speak ____ at home when everybody else is speaking English?"

	* Remember, older generations aren't *cool*.

---

## You are not allowed to judge people when their language dies

---

### This is often a tough situation for speakers

* "Supportive" or not, society wants assimilation

* Minority populations often have enough disadvantage as it is

* Teenagers aren't exactly forward-thinking

* Survival always come first

	* "$50,000 for roads, or a math textbook in our language?"

---

### Often, these problems all work in concert

* "Well, the gov't kidnapped all the kids, and now we don't have any time to teach their kids..."

* "After the genocide, the government separated speakers"

* "We were too busy rebuilding after the flood to keep teaching kids..."

So, languages die.  

### How can speakers and linguists help turn the tide?

---

# Language Revitalization

---

### Language Revitalization

An attempt to increase the number speakers and frequency of use of an endangered language

---

### Endangered Languages grow less endangered when speakers...

* Increase the language's prestige within the dominant community
* Increase their wealth
* Increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community
* Have a strong presence in the education system
* Can write down the language
* Can use electronic technology
	
	* These come from David Crystal's [Language Death](http://books.google.com/books/about/Language_Death.html?id=u_s9fR8pczMC)

---

### Methods of Language Revitalization

* Hinton gives eight steps, but there are other ways!

* Here's a pretty generic outline

---

### Step 1: Evaluate the Situation

* Are there any speakers left?

	* How old are they?
	
* What resources does the community have?  

* How do people *feel* about the language?

	* Are there "gaps"?

* What's the goal?

---

### Step 2: Document the Language

* If there are still speakers, *document everything ASAP*!

	* Get cultural *as well as* linguistic information
	
* If the language is dead, resurrect it using past work

	* ... or by using other related languages
	
* Build vocabulary for any gaps

	* What's the Navajo word for "Cell phone charger"?
	
---

### Step 3: Start teaching the adults

* Adults need to learn to be able to teach children

	* ... and to talk to adults
	
* Mentorship programs work well

	* "Hang out with this person who speaks the language, and learn"
	
* They help identify gaps, and help build early materials

* Adults can start using the language at home

---

### Step 4: Develop a niche for the language

* Resurrect old cultural practices which use the language

	* Introduce the language back into religious practices

* Create new cultural practices

	* "_______-speaking potluck!"
	
* Give people a place where speaking the language is *expected and desired*

---

### Step 5: Develop materials for teaching children

* Create second-language materials ("Hey English speaking kids, learn _____!")

	* Age-appropriate grammar materials, developed from the grammar in Step 2

	* [Berenstain Bears in Lakota](http://www.lakotabears.com)

* Create first-language materials ("Let's learn math, using ______!")

	* There are immersion schools for Maori and Hawaiian
	
	* At this point, kids *will* learn the language
	
* *This is **really** expensive and difficult*

---

### Step 6: Encourage adults to use the language at home

* Young children will grow up speaking it

* Adults will grow more proficient (by force!)

* ... but everybody needs support

	* "How the heck do you say "I'm not going to see a Michael Bay movie!!" in Massachusett?"

---

### Step 7: Expand the language into the community

* Put the language in places where the apathetic will hear it

* Local meetings and government

* Shops and commerce

* TV, Radio, Facebook, Internet

---

### Step 8: Expand the language into other communities

* Show other communities your language

* Encourage adoption by outsiders

* Encourage a broader presence online

	* Uniting disparate groups of speakers on the internet
	
	* WoW guilds in Hawaiian

* *This may not be a goal for all communities*

---

### So, in summary

---

### Steps for Language Revitalization

* Figure out the goals and resources

* Document what's left of the language and fill in blanks

* Teach adults

* Bring the language back to the culture

---

### Steps for Language Revitalization (continued)

* Teach kids to speak the language

* Put the language back into the home

* Put the language back into the community

* Expand from there!

---

Sounds easy, right?

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/false.jpg"> 

---

### Revitalization is *really* hard

---

<danger>What problems do you see with revitalization?</danger>

---

### Major barriers to revitalization

* Requires a lot of community *desire*

* Requires a lot of community *effort*

* Requires the language to be documented in the first place

	* This often requires a trained linguist, either in or out of the group

* Cost!

* Most importantly...

---

### You're still fighting the same forces that killed the language in the first place!

* Revitalization can't succeed if people still don't want to use the language

	* ... but remember, if you reach the kids, you've won

---

## How do we know if revitalization is working?

---

<danger>What good signs can you think of?</danger>

---

### Success in Revitalization

* "We have a grammar" is not success, just a first step

* If children are learning the language, you're doing well

* If children are using the language, you're doing great!

* If children are teaching their parents, you're doing *awesomely!*

* ... but the very best sign?

---

> "I've heard that teenagers are now using Lakota to talk behind their parents' backs"

---

## Revitalization Success Stories

---

### Yurok

* [Yurok](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/local/la-me-yurok-language-20130207) had six speakers

* Used a Master/Apprentice program, and Elementary/High School programs

* In 2013, "300 basic Yurok speakers, 60 with intermediate skills, 37 who are advanced and 17 who are considered conversationally fluent."

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/celebration_colbert.gif"> 
---

### Wampanoag/Massachusett

* Outright extinct for 100+ years

* A member of the tribe (and MIT-trained Linguist) created a grammar from old texts

* They now have 400 basic speakers, and will open a charter school soon

* Some children are being raised speaking Wampanoag in the home

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/celebration_fey.gif"> 

---

### Maori

* Maori faced strong threat from English in New Zealand

* Was in the process of bottom-up death (even with 60k speakers)

* Maori people went at things legislatively

	* One of three Official Languages of NZ
	
	* "[Maori is] appearing on building names, administrations, businesses and other signage along side English

---

> In fact the language's presence is so strong that Maori interpreters are readily available at all parliamentary sessions or other high level government affair should a speaker choose to use Maori.

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/celebration_hallway.gif">

---

### Hebrew!

* Died as a spoken language in 1st to 4th Centuries CE

* Survived only as a liturgical language in Judaism

* Resurrected (rebuilt, reconstructed) in the 19th Century

* Now has around 7 million speakers

	* One of Israel's official languages
	
---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/celebration_desert.gif"> 
	
---

### Wrapping Up

* Languages die for a number of reasons

* Language Revitalization is complex

* ... and really hard

* But it can work!
