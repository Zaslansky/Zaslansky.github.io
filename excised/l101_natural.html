# Natural Classes!

### Let's play a game!

### One of these sounds is not like the other...

## /t/ /k/ /p/ /s/

- /s/ is the only fricative, all the rest are voiceless stops

---

## /m/ /n/ /ŋ/ /b/

- /b/ is the only oral sound, all the rest are nasal sounds

---

## /b/ /a/ /ŋ/ /i/ /s/

- /s/ is the only voiceless sound, all the rest are voiced sounds

---

## /l/ /s/ /ŋ/ /j/ /i/

- /i/ is the only vowel, all the rest are consonants

---

## /i/ /ɪ/ /ɛ/ /æ/ /ɔ/

- /ɔ/ is the only back vowel, all the rest are front vowels

---

## /t/ /n/ /s/ /z/ /k/

- /k/ is the only non-alveolar sound

---

## /p/ /t/ /k/ /b/

- /b/ is the only voiced stop

---

### Natural Class

A grouping of sounds which share certain phonetic features

- Useful  because similar sounds tend to act similarly

    - (Sounds of a feature flock... phonologically??)

### You'll sometimes end up with groups of rules which can be simplified

- /b/ -> [p] / __#

- /d/ -> [t] / __#

- /g/ -> [k] / __#

- [voiced stops] -> [-voice] / __#

---

### Always try to generalize!

- (Where there's evidence to do so)

---

 /d/ -> [j] / __i

 /d/ -> [j] / __ɪ

 /d/ -> [j] / __e

---

/d/ -> [j] / __[Front Vowels]

- ![](humorimg/drake_yeah.jpg)

---

### Any grouping that's phonetically motivated is a natural class

- Although you'll often want to use the most specific grouping

    - Unless you're sure something applies generally, be careful!

### Natural Classes share *features*

- Features are elements of the speech process which are relevant to phonological patterns

    - [t] is [-voice], [d] is [+voice]
    
    - [n,m, ŋ] are all [+nasal]

- The best set of features to use in phonological analysis is a *huge* and fascinating question

- ... but it's not one we have time to get into this quarter

- So for now, just think about groupsof sounds, and we'll handle the rest in LIGN 111
