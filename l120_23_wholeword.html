---

### How are words being built?

- "Let's see, I need to talk about gluing this thing, again, in the past.  That's 'glue', plus 're-', and '-ed'."

- "Let's see, I need to talk about gluing this thing, again, in the past. Looks like 'reglued' is the word I need!"

---

# Let's talk about our reading

---

### Bybee 1998

> "In the traditional view, the lexicon is a storage area for all and only the content words or morphemes of a language. The lexicon is relatively static compared to the grammar, which contains all the moving parts of sentence generation: in the metaphor of a dictionary, lexical items are just passive items on a list which wait to be recruited into syntactic structures."

---

### Bybee 1998 Continued

> "Rather than arguing that a lexicon of this type does not exist, I am going to argue that if such a lexicon does exist it is because it is emergent from the storage of linguistic experience, which is of a very different nature than the traditional conception of a lexicon would suggest."

---

### "Emergent from the Storage of Linguistic Experience"

- This is the key to understanding these approaches

---

# The Storage of Linguistic Experience

---

## Is storage expensive?

---

### Morpheme-based Lexicons store only maximally analyzed stems and affixes

- Generative approaches to grammar create all and only the attested forms

- Morpheme-based lexicons are great for efficiently handling regular patterns

- They struggle with irregularity and hard-to-memorize forms

- **Computation is cheap, but storage is expensive!**

---

### In this view, we store the minimum required to do assembly

- Phonemes, which build morphemes, which build words, which build sentences

- Very little storage, lots of computation, language is *generated*

---

### What about the other end of things?

<img class="wide" src="morphology/lexicon_storage.jpg">

---

### What if storage was cheap and easy?

### What animal was on the 'Previously, on LIGN 120' slide last Friday?

A) A Duck

B) A Tiger

C) A Hedgehog

D) A Squirrel

E) A Velociraptor

---

### We have evidence that we're storing a *lot* of things

- What was the route from your childhood home to the grocery store?

- The color of your parents first car?

- Your first teacher in grade school's name?

---

## Storing Linguistic Experience

---

### What is Linguistic experience?

- Words, phrases, and sentences

- Individual phonetic realizations of words

- **Every single word ever spoken to you**

    - Potentially with metadata

---


### Are we storing individual speech tokens?

- Lightfoot 1989 found listeners retained familiarity with unknown talkers' voices after **10 days**

- <small>Lightfoot, N. (1990). Effects of familiarity on serial recall for spoken word lists. The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 87(S1):S70–S71.</small>

- Goldinger & Azuma 2004 showed that *individual tokens* affect listener production **6 days after hearing them**

    - <small>Goldinger, S. D. and Azuma, T. (2004). Episodic memory reflected in printed word naming. Psychon Bull Rev, 11(4):716–722.</small>

- What does your BFF sound like?

- *So, it's not insane to think that we're storing a lot of data*

---

### The proposed unit of storage could be *acoustic* representations of *words*

<img class="wide" src="phonmedia/sky.png">

---

### Bye bye, Phonemes and Morphemes!

- Words are stored as monolithic acoustic chunks

- We are storing the *surface forms*

    - We don't need phonemes nor phonological processing

- The smallest unit of storage is the acoustic word, stored with its semantic reference to the real world

---

### 'Word' doesn't just mean 'thing bounded by spaces'

- Anything that happens frequently and without variation could be stored

- "Mai Tai", or "For all intents and purposes", "Inflectional Morphology"

- Set phrases could be stored as 'words'

---

## I know what some of you are thinking

- <img class="wide" src="humorimg/raisedfingermeme.jpg">

---

### "How can such a model account for..."

- The 'felt' reality of phonemes and morphemes?

- Phonological rules?

- Morphological productivity?

- Morphological creativity?

- ... and, uh, Language?

---

# Emergent Grammar

---

## Emergence

When an entity is observed to have properties that its parts do not have on their own

---

<img class="wide" src="img/snowflake.jpg">

---

<img class="wide" src="img/sand_ripples.jpg">

---

## How would you describe this complex pattern?

<img class="wide" src="img/langtonsant2.gif">

---

### Langton's Ant

> At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

<img class="wide" src="img/langtonsant2.gif">

---

### Complexity can emerge despite simple rules

- We don't need elaborate rules to be a *part* of the system for the system to have elaborate patterns!

---

## Emergence in Language

---

### Let's say we've memorized a *lot* of words

- We know acoustic forms, and their mappings to semantic meanings

- We are sitting on a huge pile of forms with meanings

- **How does morphology work?**

---

<img class="small" src="morphology/sandwich_shop.jpg"> <img class="small" src="morphology/vending_machine.jpg">

---

### We grab the word we need in the moment from the pile

- ... and plug it into the sentence(s)

- No phonology or morphology needed!

- Frequency effects come for free!

    - More on this Wednesday!

---

### ... but what about creativity and productivity!

- "How are you going to handle the wugs?"

---

<img style="height:600px" src="morphology/wug_chopper.jpg">

---

### Analogy

- There are lots of form-meaning correspondences in the words we've memorized

- *We can take advantage of those to build new, understandable forms!*

---

<img class="wide" src="morphology/bybee_analogy.jpg">

---

### Sub-word units don't *exist*, they *emerge*

- 'able' is just that thing that is shared among all those words having to do with possibility

- '-en' doesn't occur in many plural forms, that can't be a thing

- Maybe 'cran-' is a type of berry?

- If 'affixed' forms occur often enough, and their 'bare stems' occur often enough, we can come to 'see' the affix as an independent entity

---

### Analogy allows productivity

- "Wug.  That's like drug, or hug, or dug, or rug. When I talk about two of those things, it seems to always end with this -z gesture.  So, [wʌgz]?"

- Phonological and morphological rules are just formalizations of patterns visible across attested surface forms

    - (which is relatively uncontroversial)
    
- Grammar comes from statistical patterns in language

    - These are quantifiable and testable!

- This is exactly how reanalysis works, even in a generative world!
    
---

### So, wrapping back...

> "Rather than arguing that a lexicon of this type does not exist, I am going to argue that if such a lexicon does exist it is because it is emergent from the storage of linguistic experience, which is of a very different nature than the traditional conception of a lexicon would suggest."

---

### Usage-based or 'Exemplar' method strengths

- Accounts easily for many phonetic phenomena

- Phonology comes 'for free'

- Frequency-based effects are built in to the model

- Easily quantifiable and testable, *given sufficient data*

- Handles notions of morphology with less complexity!

- **It's complicated, but it works!**

---

# Weaknesses of the Whole-Word Lexicon

---

## Reality of Bulk-Storage

---

### This depends on a big assumption about storage

- If we can't store this much, these theories are DOA

- ... but it sure seems like we can

---

## Morphemes sure seem real

---

### Phonological rules can seem to privelege morphemes

- "This is legal across morphemes, but not within"

- "This can only be found in this one suffix"

---

### Morphological rules can seem based on derivation

- Dutch "ge-" only works if there are no other derivational affixes

    - gesproken, but \*gebesproken
    
- Other rules depend on the presence of absence of certain morphemes

    - "Attach this as a prefix on a bare stem, but use this suffix if there's other morphology there"

---

## Morphologically Complex Languages

---

### How do we handle agglutinating languages?

<img class="wide" src="lotwimg/agglutinatingturkish.png">

---

### What about polysynthetic languages?

<img class="wide" src="morphology/wichita_gloss.jpg">

---

### Is the 'word' a sane level of storage when it is often the largest linguistic unit?

- If there's a limited number of affixes, storage is tractable

- Imagine you could add a single noun to a single verb in a language...

    - Your number of stored items increases by [#InflectedVerbForms]*[#Nouns]
    
---

## 'Word' remains tricky

---

### When we store whole words, what is that?

- How do we differentiate words from sentences?

- Idioms?

- Sub-parts?

- 'Word' is tough, here, too.

---

## This is tough for actual analysis

---

### Usage-based methods require huge amounts of data

- Saying anything meaningful about data requires statistical generalizations across that data

- "How often does this form occur relative to that one?"

- "How regularly is this affix attested across the language?"

- Usage-based Linguistics depends on easy access to huge amounts of data

    - This is intractable for language documentation
    
- You can't 'describe a language' using usage-based methods

    - Just individual phenomena!

---

### 'Analogy' turns into generative rules quickly

- Are emergent morphemes so different from stored ones?

- If we compute the grammar as needed, and make reference to that grammar, aren't we back where we started?

- It's very hard to describe big patterns without some sort of generalizations!

---

### Generative linguistics is like picking up broken glass in carpet

- Disposing of the big chunks is easy and effective

- You're gonna spend a long time chasing down those last slivers

- ... and you're still gonna need some tweezers from time to time

---

### Usage-based Linguistics is like picking up a dumptruck full of needles on a smooth concrete floor

- The task is incredibly simple, and 100% effective

- Once you're done with an area, you're done

- ... but it's going to take you forever

- ... and you'll probably want something more efficient for a big room!

---

### Wrapping Up

- Whole-Word storage privileges computation over storage

- It replaces a great deal of complexity with bags of words

- Analogy allows novel forms and productivity

- It has some weaknesses, both with the seeming reality of sub-word chunks, in complex morphology, and in practical description

---

### For Next Time

- We'll talk about frequency as a force in morphology!

- ... which absolutely bears on this discussion
