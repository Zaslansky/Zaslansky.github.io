# Caucasian and Dravidian Languages
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### Administrative Notes

* I've tweaked the schedule.  Grab the latest copy

	* No due-dates have changed, but the readings have.

* Niloo's lecture is online now.

* Will's office hours today end at 1pm

	* 1:30, if you're willing to talk while in line at the Alferd Packer grill
---

## Today's Agenda

* Ergative/Absolutive Systems

* Caucasian Languages

* Dravidian Languages

---

# Case!

---

### Today, we're wrapping up the idea of "case".

---

(Here's a touch of review, just in case)

<img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### Case marks grammatical relations

<small>(Who did what to whom)</small>

---

Fundamentally, we need to know:

* ### Who did the action?

* ### Who was directly affected by the action?

---

In linguistics, we break those into three "roles":

* **Subject** (of an intransitive sentence)

* **Agent** (of a transitive sentence)

* **Object** (of a transitive sentence)

	* (This is as complex as we'll get in this class)

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO.png"> 

---

### Languages group these roles differently in their case systems

---

"Let's mark Subject and Agent using the same morpheme!"

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_nomacc.png"> 

---

This is called a "Nominative/Accusative" system

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_nomacc_labeled.png"> 

---

### Nominative/Accusative Systems

* Group S and A together
	* The same case markers are used for S and A

	* Subjects *and* agents are nominative!

* "I slept", "I saw her"

* "*Me slept", "*Me saw her"

---

"No, let's mark Subject and **object** using the same morpheme!"

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs.png"> 

---

This is called a "Ergative/Absolutive" system

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs_labeled.png"> 

---

The case marker that marks S and O is called *Absolutive Case*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs_labeled.png"> 

---

The case marker that marks A is called *Ergative Case*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs_labeled.png"> 

<small>(Think "Erg-" as "work", as in "Ergonomics" or "Energy")</small>  <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---


### Ergative/Absolutive Systems

* Group S and O together
	* The same case markers are used for S and O

	* Subjects *and* objects are absolutive!

* Erg/Abs is less common than Nom-Acc

* Ergative/Absolutive is found in specific areas

	* Caucasian languages, Tibetan, Australian languages, Basque, some Iranian languages, some American Indian languages, 
---

### "Ergative" and "Absolutive" *replace* Nominative and Accusative Cases

* You'll never have a "Nominative" or "Accusative" case in a truly Erg/Abs system

* You'll never have an "Ergative" or "Absolutive" case in a truly Nom/Acc system

	* (Some languages do switch around, like Nepali)

---

<lang>Basque</lang><br><ldata>Isolate - "Spain"</ldata> 

* Jon etorri dira.

* Jon-ABS come AUX
* *"Jon came."*

* Nekanek Jon ikusi ditu.

* Nekane-ERG Jon-ABS seen AUX
* *"Nekane saw Jon"*

---

* Jon etorri dira. - "Jon came."

* Nekane-k Jon ikusi ditu. - "Nekane saw Jon."

* **S = Unmarked**
* **O = Unmarked**
* **A = -k**

* *Absolutive Case* = Unmarked
* *Ergative Case* = -k

---

<lang>Georgian</lang><br><ldata>Kartvelian - Georgia</ldata> 

*bitʃ‘-ma dzaghl-i bagh-ʃi damala.* 

boy-erg dog-abs garden-dat.in hid.aor

‘The boy hid the dog in the garden.’

*dzaghl-i bagh-ʃi daimala.*

dog-abs garden-dat.in hid.aor

‘The dog hid in the garden.’

* **S and O = -i** (absolutive case)
* **A = -ma** (ergative case)

# Ergativi-tea!

<img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->  

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section>

*In an Ergative/Absolutive language, which case markers would be used for the sentences:*

***"Will needlessly dissed Michael Bay. Kevin laughed."***

a) Will = ERG, Michael Bay = ABS, Kevin = ABS

b) Will = ABS, Michael Bay = ERG, Kevin = ERG

c) Will = ERG, Michael Bay = ABS, Kevin = ERG

d) Will = ABS, Michael Bay = ERG, Kevin = ABS

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section>

*In an Ergative/Absolutive language, which case markers would be used for the sentences:*

***"Michael Bay misrepresented Optimus Prime. Will cried."***

a) Michael Bay = ERG, Optimus = ABS, Will = ABS

b) Michael Bay = ABS, Optimus = ERG, Will = ERG

c) Michael Bay = ERG, Optimus = ABS, Will = ERG

d) Michael Bay = ABS, Optimus = ERG, Will = ABS

---

### ... and of course, they don't have to group, or the groupings can change.

* (Remember Nepali?)

---

This is called "Split ergativity"

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO.png"> 

---
**Nepali** - Ergative/Absolutive for *animate* subjects

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs.png"> 

---

**Nepali** - Nominative/Accusative for *inanimate* subjects

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_nomacc.png"> 

---

**Hindi/Urdu** - Ergative/Absolutive in the past

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_ergabs.png"> 

---

**Hindi/Urdu** - Nominative/Accusative in the present

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_nomacc.png"> 

---

We don't use consistent case names in these situations

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/SAO_spliterg.png"> 

---

### This is Nepali tea

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/splitergativitea.jpg">

* ## Split Ergativi-tea!

---

(Sorry) 

---

### So, there are three ways to do Case

* Nominative/Accusative - Groups S and A

* Ergative/Absolutive - Groups S and O

* Split Ergative - No grouping, or variable grouping

---

## Yay!  We're done learning how case works!

<small>Although we'll keep touching on small variations from time to time...</small>   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Speaking of Ergative languages...

---

# Caucasian Languages!

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/caucasianmap.png"> 

---

### There are three macro-families that linguists mean when we say "Caucasian"

* **Northwest Caucasian** - Kabardian, Abaza, Abkhaz

* **Northeast Caucasian** - Chechen, Lezgic

	* Some folks classify these as North Caucasian, with "West" and "East" branches

* **Kartvelian** (or "South Caucasian") - Georgian, Svan, Zan

* We can't yet trace any higher-level families for these languages

	* (but we *really* want to)

---

### The Caucasus is a "language area"

---

### Language Area 

An area where languages which are not known to be related all share some features.

---

### Features of Caucasian Languages

* Ergativity!

* Agglutinative morphology

* Ejectives and lots of consonants!

* Relatively few vowels 😢

---

## Ergativity!

* ...been there, done that, got the t-shirt

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/ergtshirt.jpg"> 

* # (It's an ergativi-tee!!!)

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/badpundog.jpg">

---

## Agglutinative morphology

---

### Agglutinative morphology

When a language sticks lots of morphemes together to make very complex words, *without changing the morphemes*

---

### Agglutinative

Think "glue", you're just sticking moprhemes together!

**This is a recurring pattern: Lots of consonants, few vowels, and vice versa**

## Dravidian Languages!

---

### Remember this map?

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/southasialanguagefamilies.jpg"> 

---

### Dravidian Languages

	* (... but not confirmed)

* Spoken by ~21% of India's population

---

### Major Dravidian Languages

* Kannada - 49m speakers

* Malayalam - 38m speakers

---

### Features of Dravidian

* Agglutinative Morphology

* SOV

* Grammatical Gender!

* Past/Non-Past tense system

* Lots of small sound distinctions!

---

### Oh, and awesome writing systems!

## Wrapping up

* Ergative languages group S and O

* Caucasian languages are awesome

	* You should know their features.

* Dravidian languages are awesome

	* You should know their features, too!

## Next time: Turkic and Semitic Languages!
