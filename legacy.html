# Language is Incredible
### Dr. Will Styler - 2022 UCSD Legacy Lecture

<http://savethevowels.org/legacy>

---

### Thanks to the UCSD Scholars' Society for hosting this talk

- To Seth McLaughlin for coordinating the process with me

- To my colleagues and students for supporting me and providing feedback

- To UCSD's LingUA for helping get out the vote and classing the place up

---

### Thanks to all the students who voted to bring me here

- This is the highest honor I could receive as a teacher

- It means the world to me that you chose me to give this talk

---

### The Prompt

> "If this were the last lecture you ever gave, what would you want to share with the world?"

---

### Using language is the most incredible and complex thing you will ever do

- ... and yet you do it every day, all day

---

### People don't generally see this

- We use language *so often* that it feels 'boring', 'normal' and 'easy'

- We stop seeing the complexity

- We stop seeing how truly bizarre it is

- We stop understanding why people spend lifetimes studying it

---

### So, rather than trying to tell you why language is incredible...

- I'm going to show you, by showing you that your language is very, very weird

- That there is more complexity than most people *ever* notice

- ... and yet it still works so well that it feels 'boring'
	
- **That** is incredible
	
---

## One quick note!

---

### The World has staggering Linguistic diversity

- More than 7000 languages spoken on Earth

- More than than 200 languages spoken here in the US

- More than 50 languages spoken in California

- **Every one of these languages is as complex, fascinating, and incredible as English is!**

---

### We're doing this talk in English

- It's the most commonly spoken language on our campus

- It's got plenty of fun chaos to make language seem weird!

- ... but English isn't the only language which is incredible!

- Be thinking about how all these ideas apply in your own languages and dialects!

---

### Our plan

- Speech is incredible

- Grammar is incredible

- Meaning is incredible

- All Language is Incredible

- Language is incredible

---

## Speech is Incredible

---

### Your writing system is lying to you

- Cheesy Legacy Lecture Example

- We fought through, though rough boughs coughed.

- Knight

- This thistle

- Unionized

---

# üêü Ghoti üêü

- 'gh' from 'tough'

- 'o' from 'women'

- 'ti' from 'fiction'

- ... and the most vile lie you've been told...

---

### AEIOU and sometimes Y

- Five vile deceptions

	- (Sometimes six)

- They hide from you the true diversity of English vowels

- Beet, bit, bet, bat, bird, but, bought, board, book, boot, boy, buy, bay, boat

	- ... and even more, depending how you count!
	
- Other languages have even more vowels than we do!

---

### So, let's put the writing system aside!

- <img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/aeiou.png">

---

## "Linguistics is the best major ever!"

---

### Your writing system hides that speech is amazingly complicated

- Individual sounds blend together

- Adjacent sounds affect each other

	- Car Keys

- You don't generally run out of air when talking

---

### Your ability to understand speech is even more incredible

---

### Let's listen to some sounds

---

### Your mind is able to turn incredible distortion into 'speech'

- 'Sine Wave Speech' has three sine waves, changing frequency to match the loudest components of speech

- Our brain is able to hear speech even here

- Incredible!

---

### Wow, we're great at using sound for speech perception!

- Let's see that again

---

### Video 1

<video controls src="video/willgurk.mp4"></video>

---

### Video 2

<video controls src="video/willgurk.mp4"></video>

---

### They're the same video!

- # üòá

---

### Speech perception isn't only about sound

- This is the McGurk Effect

- When you see 'ga ga ga' and hear 'ba ba ba', your mind tries to find the best answer!

- This shows that speech perception is 'multimodal', and doesn't just rely on the acoustic signal

---

### Every human you've ever met sounds different

- Different language background and dialects

- Different vocal tract length

- Different tongues making different shapes with a different voice

- Two different people may produce 'dead' and 'did' with *nearly identical acoustics*, and yet you'll hear them as two distinct vowels

- **You have never once given a damn!**

---

### Speech is incredible

- It's nothing like our writing system makes us think it is

- It's fluid, continuous, and complex

- We are able to perceive speech despite incredible distortion

- We use information above and beyond the acoustic signal

- ### The fact that we can create and understand speech ever, at all, is incredible

---

### We understand speech using mechanisms which we use constantly yet don't *quite* understand

- Speaking of which...

---

## Grammar is incredible

---

### What do we mean by grammar?

- Linguists have a different definition of grammar than most

---

### 'Grammar' to most people

- They're is a nice park over their.

	- 'That's the wrong form of 'there'!!!

- Jessica's a great person to travel with.

	- 'You can't end a sentence with a preposition!!!''

- There ain't much good about our writing system in English irregardless of how you look at it.

	- 'Ain't isn't a real word, and OMG IRREGARDLESS IS BAD!!!'

- **These are what we call 'prescriptive grammar' rules**

---

### Prescriptive Grammar rules are social rules

- These 'Incorrect' sentences are still understandable

- People make these 'mistakes' all the time

- Some come from older versions of the language or blind adherence to the writing system

- Some are arbitrary decisions by those in power as to what is 'correct'

- Try asking 'How do you know that's the correct form?'

- **Linguists don't worry much about this kind of grammar!**

---

### Linguists care about 'descriptive' grammar

- What rules do speakers of this dialect *tend to follow* when speaking?

- What makes language use *hard to understand* or *ambiguous*?

- How can we describe the *patterns that people tend to follow when using language*?

- How do speakers of different dialects *vary* in terms of the rules they follow?

- **These rules describe how people *actually communicate*, and what makes communication *break down***

---

### Speakers have unconscious intuitions about what's 'grammatical' and not

- Is what you're hearing or reading English?  

- Do you understand what it's saying?  

- Can those words 'go together' like that?

- Does this usage feel 'illegal' or 'not right' somehow?

- **Let's try it!**

---

### Sample Sentences

- I'm honored to present to you today.

- Jessica succulent porch obsession on growing the has an.

- Somebody stole my lamp, I'm delighted.  

- All your base are belong to us.

- Saw the car red

	- This would be perfectly fine in Spanish!

---

### We don't always 'know the rules' of our grammar

- ... but we follow them, even when they're strange

---

### English past tense forms are weird!

- sing -> sang

- ring -> rang

- bring -> brought

- sting -> stung

- ding -> dinged

---

### English plurals are weird too!

- Cats, Mutts, and laughs  (ends with /s/)

- Dogs, Professors, and Nerds (ends with /z/)

- Dishes, washes, and plusses (ends with /…™z/)

- **How do we know which form works with which words?**

---

### This is a Wug

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wug.png">

---

### Now there is another one.  There are two of them.

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wug.png"><img class="r-stretch" src="img/wug.png">

---

### There are two...


<img class="r-stretch" src="img/wug.png"><img class="r-stretch" src="img/wug.png">

---

### The Wug Test

- Developed by Jean Berko Gleason in 1958

- Designed to show that young children (and adults!) have intuitions about grammatical rules

	- ... and those intuitions can apply to words they've never heard before!
	
- **Let's see what else you know about creating words in English!**

---

### Are these words 'OK' or 'well formed' English words?

- Quieter

- Weobleing

- slowest

- Ari won the 2021 track meet, but Juan had a faster time when he won in 2022.

	- **I guess Juan was fastester.**

---

### Let's try again

- Lecture

- Breaking

- Shockingly

- I was given this honor by teaching.

	- **This is the teachingliest honor I've ever been given.**

---

### We can understand a word without it feeling 'right'

- 'fasterer' is better than 'unblueringlyer'

	- ... but it's much worse than 'unlockable'
	
- So, 'grammatical' isn't just 'yes' or 'no'
	
---

### We have similar intuitions about sentences

- Will and Jessica went out for Krispy Kreme.

- Please to be no eatings I are not tasty or nutritious.

- I talked to more people than I recognized them.

- I saw the cute black three cats.

---

### Let's build another sentence gradually and see how it goes

---

### The

---

### The boat

---

### The boat floated

---

### The boat floated down

---

### The boat floated down the

---
### The boat floated down the river

---

### The boat floated down the river sank.

---

### This is a 'Garden path' sentence

- Your brain commits to one potential 'reading' of the sentence

- Then, when you get that last word, your brain crashes

- You have back up and analyze it differently to be able to understand it

- The right pitch, timing, and intonation can make it feel OK

	- "The boat, floated down the river, sank!"


---

### How we say the sentences matters in other places!

- Run to the store and grab...

	- Cheese
	
	- M&Ms
	
	- Tea
	
	- Some avocados
	
	- Pine nuts

---

### Let's try one more set of sentences!

- Lightning round!

---

### More than cats attacked the new sofa than dogs.

---

### Most people call their friends more than I do.

---

### Pedro more went the car parking lot to in the.

---

### More of my plants are succulents than not.

---

### More people have been to Mexico than I have.

---

### Chantel saw more squirrels than Charlie and Mei.

---

### Jessica has more been to Tijuana than students.

---

### More UCSD students post raccoon memes than I do.

---

### Will makes more puns than most professors.

---

### Wait a second...

- "More people have been to Mexico than I have"

- "More UCSD students post raccoon memes than I do."

- **These make zero sense!**

- These are called 'Comparative Illusions', and come from blending two common expressions

	- "More people have been to Mexico than Bhutan" and "She's been there more than I have"

- These *feel* grammatical at first

	- ... but we crash when we try to evaluate the meaning!

---

### Grammar is incredible

- It's so much more than silly 'grammar rules' from pedants

- We have strong knowledge of what forms should be used when

- We understand that although we have lots of options, we can't always use all of them

- Some of our judgments about language forms are strong and 'black and white'

	- ... but lots of forms can fall into 'gray areas'

- ### We have strong and gradient instincts about how language works, even when we're not aware of it

---

### Yet, when meaning gets weird, those can break down

- Which brings us to our next topic...

---

## Meaning is incredible

---

### You understand what words mean, right?

- # "Truck"

---

### Let's ask a very common question in 2022

- # Are you a robot?

---

### Click on all slides containing a Truck

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_base.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_penguin.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_semi.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_pickup.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_schoolbus.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_suv.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_hamster.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_realtoy.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_skateboard.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_firetruck.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/truck_elcamino.jpg">

---

### Words have a 'core meaning'

- We call this a 'semantic prototype'

- Yet, many things which aren't quite that still feel like 'truck'

- Word meanings are *gradient*, rather than 'all or nothing'

- ... or maybe you're all just robots

---

### ... but sometimes, word meanings can shift some

- Is one 'many'?

- Is five 'many'?

- Is twenty 'many'?

- To answer this, we must answer a different question

---

### Did you hear about the bug that listens to you talk before biting you?

- Yeah, they're called **linguist-ticks!**

---

### Let's say twenty people laughed at that

- Did 'many people' laugh?

- Did 'many people' laugh if there were 22 people in the room?

- Did 'many people' laugh if there were 40 people in the room?

- Did 'many people' laugh if there were 5000 people in the room?

---

### We understand the intention of every sentence

- "Never enroll in Will's classes if you don't like puns"

- "Gonna come visit next week?"

- "Give me the enchiladas!"

- "You should really declare a linguistics major."

- "Up in the back row, students cringed in anticipation."

---

### Some sentence meanings are hard to understand without world knowledge

- "I saw the Chancellor of UCSD's Office"

- "Will brought the Chancellor up during his talk."

- "I went to the store"

- "Oh I saw him!"

- "I feel you."

---

### How about a sentence you can understand but don't know the meaning of?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/meet_me_here.jpg">

---

### We also think about *why* people say things

- "Will, who is definitely not Batman, gave a lecture."

- "Dalen sure has been hanging out with Helen a lot lately."

- "I ate some of your donuts"

- "Your watch is gone?  I wonder if Ryan's back in town."

- **We understand what's implied without even thinking about it!**

---

### Meaning is incredible

- Even single words' meanings can be tricky to pin down

- Sentence meaning is easy to understand

	- Except when it isn't
	
- Our knowledge about the world is crucial for understanding

- ... and getting some meaning requires us to make assumptions about the world

- ### We understand language's meaning with incredible nuance, using our knowledge of the world!

---

### I know what you're thinking...

- # bruh

- ... and that word is incredible, too!

---

## All Language is incredible

---

### *Everybody's* language is amazing to linguists

- There's no such thing as 'good' or 'bad' language

	- Although social situations can dictate 'proper' language use, that's social!

- Nobody speaks 'incorrectly', just differently

- Speakers of different dialects don't have 'bad grammar', they just use a different grammar

- **We believe that all language is valid and fundamentally worthy of study**

---

### We also care about lots of kinds of language use!

---

### Slang is incredible!

- If somebody's using a word and somebody else is understanding it, it's worthy of study

- You may have strong instincts about the meaning of 'yassification', 'based', 'mid', and 'simp'

	- It's quite simp to accidentally use words incorrectly
	
	- (Yes, that usage was cringe)
	
- We understand slang and find it just as useful as any other language!

- Swearing is amazing, and has fascinating linguistic features worthy of study

---

### Internet Language is incredible!

- Emoji use is 100% linguistic (üéâ)

- Internet-first linguistic forms are fascinating! (e.g. lol, smdh, dni, brb, thx)

- Keysmashing (e.g. alkjhsasdklj) is language, with meaning and social implications

- uwu is a vawid fowm of winguwistic expweshun Ôºº(Ôºæ‚ñΩÔºæ)Ôºè

---

### Memes are incredible (and they're language!)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/ungrammatical/ungram_legacy.jpg">

---

### We have linguistic intuitions about memes

- We understand the meaning of meme templates

- We are able to move elements of memes around like affixes on words

- The methods we use to describe word formation work here too!

- Memes have and change meanings like any other linguistic construct

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/memesarelanguage.jpg">

---

### Code Switching is incredible!

- 'Code Switching' is the seamless blending of two languages within a sentence or utterance by multilingual folks

- "Ma√±ana me voy al Price Center to order mis textbooks for next quarter"

- Speakers are simultaneously using elements of both languages' grammars

	- We can find fine-grained details from *both* languages in code-switching!
	
- We also code switch among our many dialects!

- *Code switching is fascinating, and should be a matter of pride, not shame!*

---

### Speaking of different languages...

---

### Signed Languages are language!

- Sign is not just 'miming' or 'spelling out another language with the hands'

- If it were just miming, you could understand all the signs!

---

### Which is 'father' and which is 'mother'?

<img class="small" src="img/asl_mom.gif"><img class="small" src="img/asl_dad.gif">

- ### MOTHER - FATHER

<small>ASL GIFs courtesy of Dr. Bill Vicars at <a href="http://www.lifeprint.com">http://www.lifeprint.com</a> </small>

---
	
### Which is 'white' and which is 'like/enjoy'?

<img class="small" src="img/asl_white.gif"><img class="small" src="img/asl_like.gif">

- ### WHITE - LIKE

---

### Which is 'paper' and which is 'cheese'?

<img class="small" src="img/asl_paper.gif"><img class="small" src="img/asl_cheese.gif">

- ### PAPER - CHEESE

---

### Some signs are 'iconic' and related to what they represent

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/asl_die.gif">

- ... but so are some words in English!  <h1>'Whoosh!'</h1>


---

### Signed languages are Language!
	
- Their grammars can differ *vastly* from nearby spoken languages

	- American Sign Language isn't even *related* to English
	
- The same linguistic theories used for spoken languages are useful and used for signed language
	
- **Signed languages are just as valid and interesting to study as spoken languages!**

---

### ... and the rest of the world's languages are amazing too!

- Different sounds!

- Different word structures!

- Different ways to build sentences!

- Different ways to talk about reality, time, space, and events!

- **Every language is just as capable of describing reality as any other language, but every language does it differently!**

---

### All human languages can teach us *something*

- Every language community can teach us something about how Language works

- No language is 'boring' or 'basic' or 'primitive'

- ... and we as linguists can collaborate with communities to help folks to document, teach, and preserve their linguistic heritage

---

### So, all language is incredible

- Whether formal or informal, prestigious or unrecognized

- Whether new or old, from Dickens or Discord

- Whether acknowledged as language or not

- Signed or Spoken

- Here or anywhere else

- ### Language is Language, no matter the form, and it's all worth celebrating!

---

### One last question...

---

### How is a legacy lecture like an extension cord?

- It has a plug at the end!

---

### You should declare a Linguistics Major or Minor!

- You'll learn how we can make sense of this madness

	- ... and find even more madness!

- LIGN 101 is a great place to start (offered every quarter and over the summer)

- More info at <https://savethevowels.org/lingmajor>

- OK, OK, back to the actual point

---

### Using language is the most incredible and complex thing you will ever do

- Speech is shockingly complex, and we don't care

- We're barely aware of our grammar, yet we use it constantly to make fine-grained decisions

- We understand nuanced meanings, informed by our understanding of the world

- Everybody languages, in different, worthwhile, and valid ways, all of which can teach us about Humanity

- Language is worth studying, and a life in language is a life well spent

	- ... because ...

---

# Language is Incredible

- ### ... and I hope you all can lega-see that now!
