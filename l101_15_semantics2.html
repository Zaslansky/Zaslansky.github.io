# Semantics and Pragmatics: Words in Worlds

### Matt Zaslansky - LIGN 101

---

### Last time, we talked about meaning, more broadly

- Truth in sentences

- Ambiguity

- Entailment
	
- "Shades of meaning"

	- Connotation vs. Denotation

---

### Today, we're going to drill into words a bit more, then talk about conversation

---

### Today's Plan

- Connotation vs. Denotation continued

- Gradient meaning!

- Word Meaning Relationships

- Word Sense

- Lexical Semantics

- Pragmatics and the Cooperative Principle

---

---

### Let's try some sets

- New, Novel, Contemporary, Up-To-Date, State-of-the-Art, Recent

- Offended, insulted, outraged, butthurt, upset

- Father, Dad, Papa, Daddy

---

### Some words have connotations that associate them with specific contexts

- "inner city" has a specific racial connotation in general use

	- "I live in Central Park West in NYC, inner city life isn't for everybody"

- "Lib" has a specific political connotation in general use

	- "Bernie Sanders is a well known lib politician"

---

### Sometimes, we take steps to avoid a negative connotation

---

## Euphemism

An indirect and "pretty" way to refer to something unpleasant or embarrassing or with a negative connotation

---

### Sample Euphemisms

- "We neutralized three combatants" rather than "We killed three enemy fighters"

- "We expect another round of downsizing" rather than "You all are gonna get fired".

- "Could you point me to the powder room?" rather than "I have to defecate immediately."

- "The children were placed in a [tender-age shelter](https://apnews.com/dc0c9a5134d14862ba7c7ad9a811160e)" rather than "We stuck the children in a detention camp".

	- This was the [ADS Word of the Year](https://www.americandialect.org/tender-age-shelter-is-2018-american-dialect-society-word-of-the-year) for 2018

---

### Connotations aren't universally shared!

- The same word may have different connotations among different groups

	- What's offensive to one group of people might be the neutral term to another
	
	- 'We prefer the term...'

- People may not be aware of the connotations of words they're using

	- 'We've decided not to have kids' vs. 'We're childfree'
	
- ... and most importantly...

---

### Connotations can change over time

- Imbecile, Idiot, Slow, Retarded, Mentally Handicapped, Developmentally Disabled

- This phenomenon (euphemisms turning into negative terms then being replaced) is called the "Euphemism Treadmill"

---

### Torture your local millenials and Gen-Xers

- "Oh, I always wondered what the internet was like in the late 1900s"

- "The world of cell phones was very different at the turn of the century"

- "Instructors used overhead projectors as late as last century"

---

### Connotations can do a *lot* of work

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/butt_dial_booty_call.jpg">

---

### The lines here are blurry

- "Butt dial" and "Booty call" may be two different compounds.

	- Booty text? Butt Text?
	
	- Or are they Adjective+Noun pairs?
	
- Does "thin" mean the same thing as "gaunt"?

- When does "idiot" stop meaning "intellectually disabled person" and start meaning "stupid person"?

- **It's hard to figure out which of many word options carries the best choice of meaning**

---

### This can lead to Semantic Change

- Where words start with one meaning and develop a new one

- This can cause a new word sense, or just an overall change in meaning

- Think 'influencer' or ' mid'

---

... But even single words are a bit hard to define

---

# Semantic Prototype Theory

---

### We have ideas about what words mean

- "Bird"

- "Chair"

---

### We also have strong intuitions about whether a word describes an object or not.

- ... but these intuitions are not binary ("yes" vs. "no")

---

### Let's test this!

---

### What is a bird?

---

### A 'Prototype'

An example of a given word or meaning which is "central" to the category, a "better example" of the idea.

---

### This captures a number of intuitions

- The Pope is pretty far from the prototype for "Bachelor"

- An emu is pretty far from the prototype for "Bird"

- A stack of pizza boxes is pretty far from the prototype for "Chair"

---

---

### So, even within a word, meaning can be a bit gradient

- ... and a single word can refer variably to many things

---

# Word Meaning Relationships

---

### Words have meanings

- Different words have related meanings

- ... and we find it helpful to talk about those relationships by classifying them

---

### Word Relationships in 101

- Synonym/Antonym

- Homonym/Homophone

- Hyponym/Hypernym

- Metonymy

---

## Synonym

A words which shares the same denotational meaning, but with different spoken form

- e.g. Cop/Police Officer, Sick/Ill, Sofa/Couch

- The usage may be slightly different, but they 'mean' the same thing

---

### "Opportunity Drawing"

- UCSD bans raffles

- They are legally complicated under California law

- Instead, we have "opportunity drawings"

- ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

## Antonym

A word which has a (nearly) opposite denotational meaning

- e.g. sick/healthy, happy/sad, dead/alive, do/undo

- "exactly" opposite is hard, but nearly opposite is fine

---

### Let's find some antonyms

- Always

- Coming

- From

- Take

- Me

- Down

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/evil_santana.jpg">

---

## Hyponym/Hypernym

- A word which is a specific instance of a broader class

	- e.g. Poodle/Dog, Laptop/Computer, iPad/Tablet, Skyscraper/Building

- The greater class is a "hypernym"

- "X is a type of Y": X are hyponyms, Y is the hypernym

---

## Metonymy

When word X, related to word Y, is used to represent the same meaning as Y.

- Beijing has rejected the offer (Beijing == Chinese Gov't)

- We speak several tongues in this classroom (Tongue == Language)

D) The Dean in "We'll have to see if the Dean approves"

E) <correct>Geisel in "Provided that Geisel agrees, we'll finalize the new library policy next week"</correct>

---

## Homonym

A word which shares the same spoken and written form, but has a different meaning

- e.g. Bank (river)/Bank (institution), Mug (coffee)/Mug (street robbery), Phone (iPhone)/Phone ([t] or [≈ã])

- **Homonyms are words which are spelled the same and sound the same but have different senses**

---

## Homophone

A word which shares the same spoken form, but has a different meaning *and is spelled differently*

- Homonym is a Hyponym of Homophone.

- e.g. they're/there, but/butt, banned/band, to/too

---

## The 'Same words' can have different meanings

- The fact that one word can have many meanings is called **polysemy**

---

### Polysemy is a BIG problem

- Roger busted the bank.

	- Is Roger a toddler with a piggy-bank, or an agent with the SEC?

- The fireplace was lit.

	- Best fireplace ever!

---

# Polysemy

---

### Word Sense

The specific meaning of a word being used in a given situation

---

### Many words have multiple senses

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/rock_medusa.jpg">

---

### Fit

- She fit the package into the over-full trunk

- She's fit to work on your project, given her background

- She's having fits about the new deadline

- She's quite fit for her age

- That fit nicely into my schedule

- She fits in well in San Diego

---

### Hit

- I hit the dragon with an arrow

- SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share

- Jiaqi loves to hit the golf course on Fridays

- The mafia hit stunned the local government

- The fingerprints had three hits on old records

- I hit on the dragon at the sleazy bar

- I hit up the dragon for some gold until payday

---

### Oh no.

---

### Verbs use different phrase structures

- We talked about how some verbs don't take an object

	- "I dreamed"

- Some verbs take an object always

	- "I hit the dragon"

- Some verbs take two objects

	- "I baked Jessica a cake"

- **Different verbs demand different arguments**

---

## Argument

Some element of a sentence which helps complete the principal meaning of the sentence.

- **Matt** hit **the dragon**

- **Xinyao** baked **Riyam** **a cake**

- **Maria** fired **six rounds**.

---

### It gets worse...

---

### Different verb *senses* demand different arguments

---

### Hit (strike)

"I hit the dragon with an arrow"

- Thing doing the hitting

- Thing being hit

- How the hitting is done (manner, or instrument)

---

### Hit (a value)

"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share"

- Thing hitting the level/goal/landmark

- The level/goal/landmark

- *No instrument argument is possible*

	- *"SchwaCo stock hit $500 a share with a good economy"

---

### Hit (go to activity)

"Jiaqi loves to hit the bowling alley with his friends"

- Person going to the activity (animate)

- Activity

- *Doesn't take an inanimate subject or an instrument*

	- *"The ball hit the links on weekends"
	
	- *"Andy loves hitting the ballfield with his bat"

---

### Hit on (make sexual advances)

"Sherry hit on Steve at the party"

- Person making the advances

- Person hit on

- *No instrument is permissible*

	- ?"Oishani hit on Jorge with a bad joke"
	
---

### Hit up (to request)

"I hit up the dragon for some gold"

- Person making the request

- Request

- Requested from

- *All three arguments are required*

	- "I hit up the dragon" (For?)

	- "I hit up for money" (Who?)
	
	- "Hit up for money" (???)
	
	- Can't be ditransitive (*"I hit up the dragon some gold")
	
---

### We can think of every verb sense as having a "Frame"

- A set of arguments which it expects

- ... which combine to give the overall meaning of the sentence

- This is often called a 'subcategorization frame'

- These are *lexically specific*

- **This information can be seen as a part of the verb's meaning**

---

### Every verb has a frame

- The [PropBank Project](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/) has been working to produce frames for every verb in large chunks of text

- [Here's the list of frames by verb](http://verbs.colorado.edu/propbank/framesets-english-aliases/)

---

### Knowing this frame is *very* useful for processing text

- Different sets of arguments can imply different verb senses

	- "Verb sense disambiguation"

- It helps us understand text better

	- "Uh oh. There's firing going on. It's the business sense. We should figure out who's doing the firing, who's being fired, and where they're being fired from."
	
- It lets us identify **semantic roles**

---

## Semantic Roles

Specific terms for different roles in the sentence

---

### Semantic Roles are tough to define

- Your book gives terms like "Agent", "Source", "Experiencer", "Theme", "Goal", "Instrument"

- Is the subject in "Darnell fit the package in the trunk" really doing the same thing as in "Darnell fits well at UCSD"?

- Is the object in "Andre the Giant threw the ball" really so different than "Andre the Giant threw the wrestler"?

- Should we spend hours discussing the details of semantic role labels?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/nope_bath.jpg">

---

### So, we'll just focus on the fact that each verb has a frame

- Each frame specifies what arguments the verb expects

- ... and that knowledge is very useful for understanding what it all means

---

### We've been talking about meaning in isolation

- "What does this verb mean, *everywhere*?"

- "What is *always* true about the relation between "up" and "down"?"

- "What is *always* true about Y, given X?"

---

### ... but words can mean something different in context

- "Can you see?"

- "I'm open"

- "Take that"

- "I feel you"

---

### When meaning stops being about the word and starts being about the situation, we've entered the land of...

---

# Pragmatics

---

## Pragmatics

The study of meaning in a discourse context

---

### Semantics is abstract

- The semantic meaning of a word doesn't depend on the context.

- The meaning of "fast" doesn't turn into "slow" in a conversation

	- We'll get to sarcasm later.

- Entailment is true *in every possible universe*.

---

### Pragmatics is contextual

- It considers the current conversation

- It assumes things about the current world

- It uses elements of our situation to 'fill in the blanks'

---

### Everything in pragmatics flows from the idea of discourse

- Conversation and linguistic interaction

- We have conversations with goals in mind

	- Social goals
	
	- Practical goals
	
	- Informational goals

- ... and we assume some cooperation

---

### The "Cooperative Principle" helps us accomplish these goals

- "I will try to act in such a way as to help the exchange of information, rather than hinder it"

- This is not a rule in the sense of grammatical rules, but a guiding principle

- It can be broken down into four maxims, developed by H. Paul Grice

---

# Gricean Maxims

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

- Do not say things you believe to be false

- Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

- Be as informative as required, but not more so

- It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

- Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

- This is also called the maxim of 'relevance'

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

- Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

- Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

- Avoid unnecessary wordyness

	- Quantity is about too much info, Manner is about too many words for too little info

- Organize your thoughts

---

### Let's test this...

Your Roommate Tasha arrives home, and asks where your other roommate Levon is. You're not sure, but you know Levon left earlier.

---

## The Maxim of Quality

**"Tell the truth and give accurate information"**

Do not say things you believe to be false

Do not say things you don't know (or have evidence to believe) to be true

---

## The Maxim of Quantity

**"Give enough information, but not too much"**

Be as informative as required, but not more so

It's just as uncooperative to give too much information as to give too little

---

## The Maxim of Relation

**"Give relevant information and only relevant information"**

Your responses should have *something* to do with the matter under discussion

---

## The Maxim of Manner

**"Be as clear as you can be"**

Don't be obscure when you can avoid it

Avoid ambiguous words or phrasings

Avoid unnecessary wordyness

Organize your thoughts

---

### The lines can be blurry

- Manner is when the right of information is presented confusingly or badly
	- Quantity is when you've *clearly* given too much or not enough information

- Relation is when you're giving the right amount of information *about something that doesn't matter to the conversation*
	- Quantity is when you're giving too much or too little information about what does matter
	
- The boundaries are fluid, and generally, there are multiple maxims being violated at once!

---

## Next time

- We'll wrap up Gricean maxims and talk about other elements of pragmatics

- Bring meaning, in context
