# Memes are language: Change my mind
### Dr. Will Styler

---

### Today's Plan

- Are memes language?

- Why does that matter?

---

### We're going to focus on images today

- In the modern, internet-focused definition of 'meme'

- ... but these same arguments could be made for videos, phrases, etc...

---

# Are memes linguistic?

---

### What makes language languagey?

- There are many people who've talked about this!

- There's not a consensus on exactly what makes Language language

- ... but there are a number of features which most folks agree on

- **If memes are language, they should fit these characteristics!**

---

### Language Characteristics

- Semanticity

- Arbitrariness of form and meaning

- Speaker knowledge of grammaticality

- Full productivity and creativity

- Social transmission

- Compositionality

- Accomplishes linguistic functions (e.g. assertions, questions, commands, expressives)

---

## Semanticity

---

### Elements of language have meaning

- The /-z/ suffix in 'memes' has a defined meaning

- "Penguin" has a defined meaning

- "I went to the park" has a defined meaning

---

### Memes are meaningless

---

### Memes have meaning

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/drake_yeah.jpg">

---

## Arbitraryness

---

### Arbitrariness of form and meaning

- The meaning of ⛄ is closely related to its form, it is 'iconic'

- The meaning of /kæt/ is *not* related to its form

- In language, the relationship between form and meaning is *arbitrary*

---

### Meme Iconicity

- Memes are often strongly iconic

	- Relying on facial expressions

	- Photos of situations
	
	- The meaning of 'templates' is based on their image

- Meanings are often grounded in specific cultural contexts

- Memes can become more abstract and less iconic over time!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/orly.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/tell_me_y.jpg">

---

### Some meanings require a bit more understanding

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/brian_blank.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/inevitable.jpg">

---

### ... but memes can become more abstract

---

### Abstraction of memes

- Many memes are iconic, but some templates and meme formats can approach arbitrariness!

- Very concrete and iconic memes can detach from their forms

---

### Content Warning: Miscarriage

---

### Loss

- Originally posted by the webcomic [Ctrl+Alt+Del](https://cad-comic.com/)

- A very serious comic about the author and his wife losing a pregnancy

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/loss/loss_original.jpg">

---

### Loss

- This comic was... strongly criticized

	- Didn't fit the tone of the strip

	- The dramatic element was widely considered to be poorly done

- Vigorous parody began

- Hiding 'Loss' references became a meme of itself

	- 'Is this loss?'

---

### Sharing disguised loss memes is a meme of its own

- (and it's not one that's widely appreciated)

- <img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/crow_of_judgement.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/loss/loss_daddy.png">

---

### Loss memes have become very abstract

- Distant from the original iconic form of Loss

---

### So, many meme templates are mostly iconic

- Some require cultural or social knowledge

- ... and some have abstracted away from iconicity completely

- **This one's questionable for memes!**

---

## Grammaticality Judgements

---

### Humans know when language is being used 'incorrectly'

- \*Please to be attending classes in this Wednesday more to find out.

- We'll go into a lot more nuance!

---

### We have the same sensations about memes

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/ungrammatical/ungram_saladcat.jpg">

---

### We'll focus on this later!

- *So this week, be looking for 'bad' or 'incorrectly made' memes*

---

## Productivity and Creativity

---

### Language is productive and creative

- Language can produce an infinite set of meanings

- Sub-elements of language can be recombined to produce new and different language

- Language can be used to describe anything (given time!)

---

### Memes are productive

- Able to be adapted to new scenarios

- Templates can be combined or re-used to create new memes

- Memes can be combined to produce new memes

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/academic_debate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/abstraction/catcreation.jpg">

---

### Memes are creative

- New memes can be created for situations

- 'You've got a meme for everything'

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/exemplar_ring.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/measure_nasality_acoustically.jpg">

---

### New meme templates can always be born

- See [Reddit's /r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/)

- ... and the rest of the internet

---

### [Tiger King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_King) was released on March 20th, 2020

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/financially_recover.jpg">

---

*<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/tiger_king_salad_cat.jpg">

---

### Images can go from 'funny image' to 'meme template' with repeated use

- This is referred to as 'lexicalization' when it happens to words

---

### Memes can be used to describe any situation

- ... and new memes can be generated to fill in any gaps

- Memes are both **creative** and **productive**

---

## Traditional Transmission

---

### Language is learned from others' language use

- Our language is dictated by the language we're exposed to

- Cultural knowledge is included

- Our language represents our social groups

---

### Memes are transmitted traditionally

- Memes are culturally and socially specific

- Memes spread within subcultures before reaching 'mainstream'

- We can tell facts about people from their meme choices

- Some memes need in-group knowledge to be understood

---

### Memes from Will's Era

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/youwinthisround.jpg">

---

### Boomer memes

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/boomer/boomer_food.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/boomer/minion_old.jpg">

---

### Memes can 'index' certain identities and social affiliations

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/nevercomingout.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/pepe.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/languagefacts.jpg">

---

### Memes often need in-group knowledge

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/slavic_accusative.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/pie_lana_del_rey.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/sociolinguistics.jpg">

---

### Memes have traditional transmission

- They are learned from other meme users

- They are bundled with and index sociocultural information

- Your upbringing and environment play a strong role in determining how you use and understand them

- **Yup, that's languagey!**

---

## Compositionality

---

### Language is compositional

- Larger wholes are made up of smaller parts, each contributing part of the meaning

- 'Unlockable' (un+lock+able)

- "I'm never gonna give you up."

---

### Memes are compositional

- The captions themselves carry meaning (duh)

- Meme templates carry meaning too!

- Other stylistic elements can carry meaning

---

### Meme template meaning

- Changing ONLY the template changes the meaning

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/minimalpairs/triplet_2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/minimalpairs/triplet_3.jpg">

---

### Meme style cues have meaning in isolation too

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/deepfried_1.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/form/allisonbell.jpg">

---

### Memes are compositional!

- They're evaluable in terms of many components, each contributing meaning

- These meaning components are productive, and can be re-used elsewhere

---

## Linguistic Functions

---

### Language accomplishes functions

- We can make simple assertive sentences
	
	- "The duck quacked at his bae"

- We can ask questions

	- "Who posted the loss meme?"

- We can issue directives

	- "Declare a LING major."

- We can express our feelings

	- "I'm confused by deep fried memes"

- We can change things about the world

	- "I sentence you to ten hours of community service"

---

### Memes can make simple assertions

---

### Memes can ask questions

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/whynotboth.jpg">

---

### Memes can issue directives

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/dewit.gif">

---

### Memes can express our feelings

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/confused.gif">

---

### Memes can change things about the world

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="memes/ban.gif">

---

### Memes can accomplish the same purposes as language!

- Boy, it sure seems like...

---

# Memes have almost all of the characteristics of language!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/coolstoryhouse.jpg">

- Why do we care?

---

## Linguistics can help us understand memes!

---

### Most subfields have meme-related questions!

- Phonology/Phonotactics

	- What form elements can co-occur?  What's not a legal combination

- Morphology

	- What are the correspondences between meme form and meaning?

	- How do memes go from funny pictures to productive chunks of meaning and form?

- Semantics

	- How do we describe the meaning of memes?

- Pragmatics

	- What effects do context and discourse have on meme meaning?

---

### Meme Linguistics continued!

- Sociolinguistics

	- What does meme use tell us about people's social life?

	- How are memes used to index social identity?

- Conversation and Discourse Analysis

	- What roles do memes play in advancing conversations and discourse?

- Translation theory

	- Can a meme be translated effectively into another language or culture?

	- Can memes be made into text?

- Diachronic Linguistics

	- How do memes change over time?
	
	- Do memes follow the same patterns as language?

---

### Learning about memes teaches us about language, and vice versa

- <img class="r-stretch" src="memes/stonks.jpg">

---

### Wrapping up

- Memes are bits of cultural information which are spread from person to person

- They share many of the properties often attributed to conventional signed and spoken language

- Linguistic tools and methods are useful for their analysis

---
