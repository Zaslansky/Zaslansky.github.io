## Morphology 2, and English is Drunk

### LIGN 101 - Matt Zaslansky

---

### Today's Plan
- How do languages generally make words? (Morphological Type)

- Inflection vs. Derivation

- Where to draw the line between morphology and phonology?

- Go home, English, you're drunk

---

### Do languages differ in how they like to build their words?

- Of course!

---


## Morphological Type

---

### Morphological Type

A means of categorizing how languages put words together

- Linguists have found this useful for comparing word-building strategies *across languages*

One relevant dimension asks a common question: ***Do words have lots of morphemes or few?***

---

### Do words have lots of morphemes or few?

* If words have few morphemes (like English or Chinese), they're "isolating"

* If they have many (like Spanish or German), they're "synthetic"

	* Languages where whole sentences are single words are sometimes called "polysynthetic"

---

<lang>English</lang><br><ldata>IE:Germanic - All over</ldata> 
 
I did see the cat on the street, he's cute.

I did see DEF cat on DEF street he-be.3sg cute.

* Only one morpheme in most words! ***This is Isolating!***

---

<lang>Russian</lang><br><ldata>IE:Slavic - Russian</ldata> 

Ti uhodila so mnoi

Ti u-hodi-la so mnoi

2sg.NOM away-go.IMPERF-past.FEM with 1sg.INST

"You left with me"

* This is looking more **synthetic!**

---

<lang>Spanish</lang><br><ldata>IE:Italic - All over</ldata> 
 
*Esta escribiéndomelo*

be.3sg write-GER-1sg.DAT-3sg.MASC

'He/she is writing it to me.'

* Lots of morphemes per word! ***This is Synthetic!***

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="lotwimg/agglutinatingturkish.png">

- Whoa, that's a lot of morphemes. **Synthetic!**

---

<lang>Turkish</lang><br><ldata>Turkic - Turkey</ldata> 

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/turkish_agglutination.jpg">

<lang>Wichita</lang><br><ldata>Caddoan - Oklahoma</ldata>

Kiyakiicíwa:cé:hirʔasʔirhawi

‘There was the big buffalo lying there.’

* Uh... yeah. ***This is polysynthetic!***

---

### It's always a continuum

* English is isolating, but Mandarin is *more* isolating

* These are always properties of subsections of the grammar and not necessarily the whole language!

	* Turkish verbs exhibit more synthesis than Turkish nouns do, for example. 

* Few languages are as polysynthetic as Wichita, but that's OK!
	
---

### Morphological Type - Review!

* If a language has few morphemes per word, it's *isolating*

* If the language has multiple morphemes per word, it's *synthetic*

---


### So far, we've been talking about building *new words*

- "How do I create a new word that I can use in a sentence?"

---

### This is called 'Derivational Morphology'

---

### Derivational Morphology

- Attaching affixes that change the part of speech of the root, or change something important about the meaning

- The meaning changes don't apply to all words, and are sometimes unpredictable

---

### Examples of Derivational Morphology

- control (verb) -> controllable (adjective)

- amaze (verb) -> amazement (noun)

- joy (noun) -> joyful (adjective)

- teach (verb) -> teacher (noun)

- roll (verb) -> unroll (verb)

- write (verb) -> rewrite (verb)

- fair (adjective) -> unfair (adjective)

---

### Examples of Derivational Morphology

- nugged up

- https://youtu.be/XmD0nh7UNCw?si=Ubn2HWDh1-VdGagI&t=1808

- nugged up?

- nugget (noun) -> nug (noun) *clipping*

- nug (noun) -> nug (up) (verb) *zero derivation*

- nug up (verb) nugged up (participial verb) *inflection after the derivation of a new verb!*

---

### Inflectional Morphology

- Inflectional morphology predictably changes the meaning of the word in the sentence, but doesn't change the part of speech or meaning of the whole word in a deep way.

- Inflectional morphology is *often added at the time of speaking*

---

### Examples of Inflectional Morphology in English

- cat -> cats (-s plural marker)
- we sing -> he sings (-s 3rd person singular marker)
- he walks -> he walked (-ed 3sg past tense marker)

---

### Inflectional Morphology around the World

---

### Khanty (Western Siberia)

xot 'house'

- xot-yyn 'two houses (dual)'

- xot-yt 'houses (plural)'

---

### Russian (Transliterated)

- Devushk-a videt sobak-u

  - The girl sees the dog
  
- Devushk-u videt sobak-a

  - The dog sees the girl
  
- This is a *case system*.  We'll talk more about those later.

---

### Somali

- xoola-hayga 'my herd'

- xoola-haaga 'your herd'

- xoola-heeda 'her herd'

- xooli-hiisa 'his herd'

---

### Spanish

- Habl-o 'I speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-as 'You speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-a 'He/She/It speaks (Present tense)'

- Habl-amos 'We speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-ais 'Y'all speak (Present tense)'

- Habl-an 'They speak (Present tense)'

---

### Inflectional Paradigms

- We have been looking at <strong>inflectional paradigms</strong> (AKA <strong>morphological paradigms</strong>)

- Categories of inflection are usually predetermined by the organization of the language

	- English speakers, for instance, know that a word like <em>bottle</em> will have a plural form </em>bottles

	- because the two categories of number (singular and plural) are required by the grammar in other places, like <em>ox</em>:<em>oxen</em>, <em>dish</em>:<em>dishes</em>, etc

- This is how even young children know that a <em>wug</em> changes form in the plural when there are two of them!

- Categories like singular and plural contrast with one another, forming contrastive pairs in a <strong>paradigm</strong>.

---
### A verb paradigm in Spanish

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/spanish_paradigm.jpg">

---

### English: "Mom, can we stop and get inflectional morphology?"

- ### Mom: "We have inflectional Morphology at home"

---

### Inflectional morphology at home:

<img class="r-stretch" src="morphology/english_inflectional.jpg"> 

---

### So, we have derivational and inflectional morphology

- Derivational morphology is used to build new words

- Inflectional morphology changes their meanings in predictable ways in sentences

- The line between these can get blurry in some cases

- Most languages do a bit of each!

---

## Now, for something completely different

---

## Language Warning

* We discuss Language

	* All of it

* We may discuss taboo subjects, words, constructions, or concepts

* It's all meant to further academic pursuits

* Please come talk to me if you have any concerns.

---

## English, a drunken thug or just a morphologist?

### LING 101 - Matt Zaslansky

---

### "Why can't these immigrants just learn English?!?"

---

## "Uh, have you looked at English lately??"

---

### Nearly every part of this language is completely bizarre.

* Non-Native Speakers: You know the deal.

---

Let's look at this from an outsider's perspective

---

### English has done a **lot** of theft

---

**English**

All *human* beings are born free and *equal* in *dignity* and rights. They are *endowed* with *reason* and *conscience* and should *act* towards one *another* in a *spirit* of brotherhood.

**French**

Tous les êtres humains naissent libres et égaux en dignité et en droits. Ils sont doués de raison et de conscience et doivent agir les uns envers les autres dans un esprit de fraternité.

---

### On the 'Purity' of the English language...

>"We don’t just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary."
> --James D. Nicoll

---

<section data-background="humorimg/darkalley.jpg"></section>

---

### No language is an island

- Most languages borrow terms from elsewhere

* (but English is a thug)

	* ... and 'thug' is a loanword from Hindi!

---

## The Writing System

---

<img src="phonmedia/aeiou.png">

---

# Ghoti

<img class="big" src="img/fish_dieter.jpg">

---

### Ghoti

* "gh" from "rough"

* "o" from "women"

* "ti" from "action"

* Pronounced like "Fish"

---

## Knight

<img class="big" src="humorimg/blackknight.jpg">

---

- For a phonologist or a phonetician, our orthography (our writing system) <em>does</em> seem like a liar and a thug.

- night and knight used to be pronounced differently, but the distinction vanished in the 17th century

- witch and which used to be pronounced differently

- right and write used to be pronounced differently

---

# English Orthography: A redemption arc?

- English writing does more than just preserve extinct phonological distinctions and annoy phoneticians

- It's also an unsung hero of Morphology

	- The /s/ in rice, please, and cats is all the same phoneme, but only the plural morpheme -s is written as <em>s</em>
	
	- The /əs/ in <em>platypus, practice, and marvelous</em> is written three different ways
	
		- But this helps to identify the -ous morpheme in marvelous, telling us that it is an adjective like <em>fabulous</em> or <em>tedious</em>

- Yeah, this is definitely my linguistic 'hear-me-out-guys.' Orthography gets a lot of hate from us linguists, not always deserved!

### The correct past tense of the verb 'dive' is...

a) dived

b) dove

c) diven

d) doved

e) doven

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### The correct past tense of the verb 'dive' is...

a) <correct>dived</correct>

b) <correct>dove</correct>

c) diven

d) doved

e) doven

---

## Ablaut

---

### Some English verbs change vowels to get their past tense

- Sing -> Sang
- Ring -> Rang
- Bring -> Brought
- Sting -> Stung
- Ding -> Dinged
- Smite -> Smote
- Bite -> Bit
- Yeet -> Yote?

---

### A pet peeve of mine

- These are not 'irregular verbs'

- Irregular means that there is not a generalizable pattern

- But English speakers clearly generalize some ablaut patterns because we <strong>are still making new verbs with these!</strong>

	- <em>dove</em> was not a prominent past tense form of <em>dive</em> until last century!
	
	- This once so-called 'regular' verb took on the ablaut pattern of write:wrote::dive:X

---
### write:wrote::dive:X isn't the only analogical change

### ... and their meanings can be really odd

- "John works at Art of Espresso. He's a coffee grinder."

- "Mark has retired three times now. He's a serial retirer."

- "I just downloaded a new YouTube app.  It's a great YouTuber."

- "Mark builds armor, he's an armorer.  Steven builds hooks, he's a ..."

---

### ... but it has exactly one infix

---

### Infix

A affix which is inserted into the middle of the word 
 
---

Will I tell you what it is?

* ### Abso-fucking-lutely

---

### "Fucking" is the only infix in the English language

* ... and it has very strict rules where it can go

---

### Add a -fucking- infix to the word "constitutional"

a) Cons-fucking-titutional

b) Consti-fucking-tutional

c) Constitu-fucking-tional

d) Constitution-fucking-al

<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### *Expletives must occur immediately prior to the stressed syllable*

* "Missi-fucking-sippi"
	
	* *Miss-fucking-isippi

* "He's a deon-fucking-tologist"

* "Antidisestablishmen-fucking-tarianism"

---

It's time to talk about these issues

---

## It

---

It ate my homework

* It's getting hot in here

* It burns when I eat Habañeros

* It sucks when Michael Bay remakes your childhood favorites

* It's about time we fix our writing system

---

### Expletive 'it'

- Contributes nothing to the meaning of the sentence

    - ... but does serve a syntactic role
    
- "It" is a subject for sentences where there's no subject at all

---

### Shouldn't we do something about that?

* Which means the same thing as "Should we do something about that?"

	* Go home English, you're drunk.

		* (Shouldn't that be "drinked")?

---

### I give up

* Speaking of which...

---

## Verb particle constructions

---

### Verb Particle Constructions

When a verb has a different meaning when coupled with a particular preposition or particle

---

### Cut - to slice

* Cut in - To offer somebody a part of a venture

* Cut out - To stop something, or remove somebody from a venture, or lose audio

* Cut with - To adulterate a drug

* Cut off - To cease financial support, or merge leaving too little space

	* ... or remove a smaller part than the whole

* Cut it - To suffice for a task

---

### Cut continued

* Cut up - To slice into small pieces

* Cut down - To shorten something

* Cut across/through - To shorten one's route by traversing an open space

* Cut on - To repeatedly make small cutting strokes at the periphery of an object

* Cut back - To reduce an existing option or investment, travel back in story

---

Sometimes, we don't know if we want the verb particle construction, or the preposition!

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup1.png">

---

### *Cut up the center of the fabric*

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/cutup2.png">

---

### These differences can have major consequences

---

### "Jackie stole my lunchbox..."

* "... then she threw my lunch up on the roof"

* "... then she threw up my lunch on the roof"

---

## We have other particles

---

### The 'to' in 'to go'

- Apparently, syntacticians have punted on this and call it a 'particle'

- In computational linguistics, we just call it 'to' and wash our hands of it

- Either way, it's going to cause problems

    - Like 'it'

---


### Then there's the really crazy stuff

---

*Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.*

* This is a fully grammatical sentence

	* Buffalo NY, Buffalo (the animal), and the verb "buffalo" (to bully)

* "New York bison whom other New York bison bully, themselves bully New York bison".

---

<img class="big" src="humorimg/surprisedbuffalo.jpg">

---

## It's not just English!

---

### English happens to be absolutely insane

* It's filled with irregularities, weirdnesses, odd constructions, and other silliness

* *... but that's no different than any other language.*

---

## All languages are crazy!

* We're simplifying languages left and right for this class

	* Partly because we don't have the time

	* ... and because if we didn't, you'd run screaming

---

### The Tibetan Writing system is even more out of date than English's

![](lotwimg/tibetan.jpg)

---

### The Real Russian Case System

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/russiancaseendings.gif"> 

---

### Spanish Verbal Hell

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/spanishverbs.jpg">

---

### ... and that craziness is why linguists love language so much!

---

### Wrapping up

* English is bat-poop cray-cray, in so many ways

	* (Partly because you understood that sentence)

* ... but so is every other language

* That's why we love them

* Second language learners are fighting an uphill battle.  Be kind!
