# Inflection and Derivation
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### Today's Plan

- Inflection, Derivation, and Split Morphology

- Lexical Families

- Inflectional Paradigms

---

# How are words constructed when making language?

---

### We've been thinking mostly about the surface result

- "What's present at the end of the process"

- ... but there's a process involved!

- **What is the nature of word formation in actual linguistic practice?**

---

## The Split-Morphology Hypothesis

---

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/split_morphology.jpg">

---

### Why might we want Morphology to be split?

- Many argue there are two stages of word construction!

---

### Two 'types' of word formation

- Deriving or creating 'new words'

    - By Derivation (e.g. read -> readable, reader, unread)
    
    - Or by Compounding (e.g. readthrough, sight read, proofread)
    
    - These form *lexical families* of derivationally-related lexemes
    
- Inflecting words to make the *gramatically necessary* forms *during language use*

    - Read -> reads, read, is read, has read
    
    - These form *paradigms* of inflectionally-related word forms

---

### Inflection vs. Derivation Intuitions

- What 'belongs in the dictionary'?

    - Reader?  Reading?  Reads?  Proofread?
    
    - Nerd?  Nerdy?  Nerds?  Nerding?  Nerd out?

- What forms are missing?

    - Can you think of a noun which can't take a plural?
    
    - Can you think of an adjective which can't take un-?
    
- What affixes change the lexical category of the base?

- What affixes leave the word 'meaning the same thing'?
    
---

### So, how do we split morphology?

---

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/split_morphology_labeled.jpg">

---

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/split_morphology_redirected.jpg">

---

### These represent two very different worlds

- Not just for morphology!

- We're not going to take a strong stand on which one is correct

- We'll focus on the consequences of either of these perspectives for Language

- But we will treat the inflection vs. derivation distinction as useful and meaningful

---

# Paradigms and Inflection

---

## Inflectional Morphology

The addition of morphemes which change the meaning of a lexeme *in a given linguistic or grammatical context*

---

### Certain grammatical contexts demand certain forms

- \*"I see three cat yesterday"

    - <clg>I saw three cats yesterday</clg>

- \*"John walk to work and see Jane dog"

    - <clg>John walked to work and saw Jane's dog</clg>

- \*"Walk in nature make me feel more alive"

    - <clg>Walking in nature makes me feel more alive</clg>

---

### These forms are *very* predictable

- A given grammatical (e.g. 3sg) or situational (e.g. plural, past) context requires certain morphemes

- We do not need to memorize (most of) them

- These new word forms are generated 'on the fly'

---

### Inflectional Forms form Paradigms

---

## Paradigm

A set of word-forms which belong to a single lexeme

- Noun paradigms are often called *declension classes*

- Verb paradigms are often called *verb conjugations*

---

# Word Families and Derivation

---

## How are words created?

---

## Lexeme

A single unit of form and meaning, which may have many word-forms

---

### Sometimes, lexemes are just made up

- 'yeet'

- 'google'

- 'uber'*

- 'xerox'

- These words are *roots*, and are not analyzable

- **These words were not created from an existing word!**

---

### Often, new word-forms are created from existing lexemes

- burn -> 'burner'

- left -> 'lefty'

- boy, soy -> 'soyboy'

- pad, phone, OS -> iPad, iPhone, iOS

- beauty -> 'beautiful'

- tender -> 'tenderness'

- **These words are analyzable, and multi-morphemic!**

---

## Derivational Morphology

Adding affixes or other morphological units to a lexeme to create a new word forms

---

### This process creates 'families' of words

- A list of word-forms which are all *derivationally related* to a single lexeme

- Pretty, Prettily, Prettyish, Non-Pretty, Anti-Pretty, Prettify?

- Tight, tighten, overtighten, tightener, tight-ish, anti-tighten? 

- Rock, rocklike, Rocky, De-rock, derocker, non-rock, Rockify/Rocken?

---

### What about these?

- Hook, Unhook, Rehook, Hooky, Hookup, Right Hook, Fish-hook

- Rock, rocker, rock out, anti-rock, rock-esque

- These are not considered word families

    - *1) They introduce new concepts*

    - *2) The lexical category of the bases are different*

    - *3) The meanings are unpredictable (e.g. rocker, hooker)*
    
- ... but this is still derivational morphology!

---

### Word families can be treated like paradigms

### ... but they're often incomplete

- Not all derivational affixes can apply to all lexemes

- There's less contrast in 'sweeten' vs 'sweetify', 'unhappy' vs. 'non-happy' 

    - Compare 'cat' vs. 'cats', 'walk' vs. 'walked'

- The process is less predictable

    - You don't know whether an affix 'works' without language knowledge
    
    - The meanings aren't clear, necessarily

---

### So, we have derivation and inflection

- One builds paradigms, and changes words 'online' according to situational or grammatical context

- One builds lexical families, and seems to produce new words which belong in the dictionary

- **What's the problem?**

---

# Distinguishing Derivation and Inflection

---

### How can you tell these apart?

- "Am I looking at two members of a lexical family, or two forms in the same paradigm?"

- "Where, in a split-morphology point of view, was this word formed?"

### This can be trickier than it seems!

---

### Sometimes, it's tricky

- In Spanish, the diminutive is '-it@'

    - Gato -> Gatito
    - Señora -> Señorita
    - Libro -> Librito
    - Ardilla -> Ardillita
    
- ... but both 'gatos' and 'gatitos' can be pluralized

- Is the Spanish diminutive inflection or derivation?

---

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/split_morphology_labeled.jpg">

---

### Many linguists consider this a *continuum*

- <img class="wide" src="morphology/inflection_continuum.jpg">

---

### Your textbook gives you a list of properties

<img class="wide" src="morphology/inflectionderivationtable.jpg">

---

### ... but even those point to gradience!

<img class="wide" src="morphology/inflection_continuum_table.jpg">

---
### What does this mean for split morphology?

<img class="wide" src="diagrams/split_morphology_labeled.jpg">

---

### It's complicated!

- Luckily, we don't need to make hard-and-fast decisions

- We can think about the theoretical issues

- ... and talk about the things that are *classically considered* inflectional or derivational

---

### Wrapping Up

- There's theoretical debate about the nature of morphology in the mind

- Some morphology feels inflectional, some feels derivational

- Inflectional seems like it builds new word forms *on-line* in paradigms

- Derivational morphology seems to create new word form families in the lexicon

- The line is blurry, but that's OK!

---

## For Next Time

- We'll dive into inflection a bit more!
