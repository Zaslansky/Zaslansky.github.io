### Awkward metaphor time!

---

### If sounds are pieces of clothing, phonology is a LOT like fashion

- ... because in any given language ...

---

### Some sounds go together, some sounds 'clash'

- /hej/

- /plej/

- /hlej/

---

### Some sounds just aren‚Äôt available in a given language

### In phonology, something that ‚Äúclashes‚Äù is referred to as being marked

---

### There are rules to describe what needs to change

- [shoes] -> [+black] OR [+brown]  /  [formal]__[occasions]

- [white clothes] -> √∏  /  [memorial day]__[labor day]

- [pattern] -> [‚àùpattern] / __[‚àùpattern]__

- [watch band] -> [+leather] / [tuxedo]__

---

### People don't know the rules, but they follow them once they've had exposure

- ‚ÄúI know that outfit is awful, but I don‚Äôt know how to describe it‚Äù

- ‚ÄúWell, no, /f…™ És/ is wrong.  It just is.‚Äù

### We learn what is and isn‚Äôt OK through long-term exposure to language and the help of those around us

### What's acceptable or not differs across different languages, cultures, and settings

### We borrow forms and rules freely from neighboring cultures and peoples

---

### The patterns change over time

### The rules you follow say something about you, socially and culturally

### When you're not following the same rules as everybody else, it sticks out

---

### So, phonology is the process by which we combine sounds so that they don't clash

- ... and adjust them to pull off a üî• new look
