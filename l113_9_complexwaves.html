# Complex Waves and Phase

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- What are complex sounds?

- What is interference?

- What is 'phase'?

- How do we visualize and analyze complex sounds?

---

### Last time, we talked about basic properties of sound

- Amplitude, Duration, Period, Frequency and Wavelength

- ... and we ended with a sound that's... not quite like the others

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

---

### We've been looking at sine waves

- Sounds which have just one *frequency component*

- These are relatively rare in nature!

	- It's positively sineful that we've focused there

- Most actual sources of sound generate multiple frequencies naturally

---

### ... and our ears (almost) never just hear one frequency

- Because we're surrounded by noise!

- Noise arriving at the ear is additive

- We only hear one waveform per ear, no matter the source(s)

---

### So, we should probably talk about...

---

## Complex Sounds

---

### Complex Sounds

- Sounds which are made up of more than one *component frequency*

- Also, *aperiodic* sounds, which aren't naturally derived from specific frequencies

---

### We're going to work with simplified complex sounds today

- But the world is full of more complex complexity 

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg">

---

### How do we create complex sounds?

- By making multiple sounds at the same time!

- Or, mathematically, using addition!

### Let's look at this process in a bit more detail!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_2x_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_3x_90_separate.jpg">

---

### You can add very different frequencies!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### Why would sounds be combined together using addition?

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### The sum of two waves is the sum of their pressures at any given point

- Which gives rise to...

---

## Interference

---

### Interference

- Multiple signals are 'interfering' with one another when they collide and affect one another

- *Affect* means just that!  Any effect at all!

- There are two main kinds of interference in audio

	- Constructive Interference

	- Destructive Interference

---

### Constructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **stronger**

- When peaks add together with peaks

---

### Destructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **weaker**

- When peaks add together with valleys

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### ... but wait

- Those sounds had the same frequency

- The same amplitude

- ... and the same duration

- One pair combined constructively, and the other pair destructively

- ### What's the difference?

---

## Phase

---

### Phase

- The point of the cycle in which a sound 'starts'

- The 'orientation' of the wave in time

- We measure phase in Degrees (°)

	- 0° is the base, and is the same as 360°

	- 180° is the exact opposite phase from 0°

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_phases_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase is important for adding sounds together!

- Sounds that are 'in phase' experience constructive interference

- Sounds that are 'out of phase' experience destructive interference

    - Also called 'phase cancellation' here

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference/Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### Complete cancellation is relatively rare!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_amplified_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase effects aren't all-or-nothing

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_offbad_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_off_separate.jpg">

---

### Aside: Applied Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/noise_cancelling_headphones.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/muffler.jpg">

---

### Humans can't detect phase

- It doesn't matter what phase a sound starts on to us

- But it's crucial when making complex sounds!

---

### Subtle Phase differences matter!

---

---

# Complex Sounds are everywhere!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg">

---

### How do we understand their components?

- Using spectra or spectrograms

- Using a **Fourier Transform** lets us understand the component frequencies and their phases

- 'This signal is made up of which component signals?'

---

**If you haven't heard about spectrograms and spectra before, watch [this video starting at 12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NqlXr59_c)**

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59NqlXr59_c>

This goes into a bit more detail (and allows me to be kind to the folks who've had 110 and/or 112)

---

### Here's a nice video on Fourier Transforms

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY>

"But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction" by 3Blue1Brown

---

### We've been looking at waveforms!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

- They show the combined, complex signal!

---

### Spectra show frequencies and their powers

- Also known as 'FFTs' or 'Spectral Slices'

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf_spectrum.jpg">

---

### FFTs give us the component frequencies

- ... and their power

- Phase is also recoverable using FFTs

- ... but we want time!

---

### Spectrograms show frequency and power over time!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf_spectrogram.jpg">

### Fourier analysis works for any complex sound!

### Our cochleas are doing something like fourier analysis!

### Today we've learned about Complex Waves
