# Who are you?

* What's your year?

* Ling majors?

* Monolingual/Bilingual/Multilingual?

* What languages do we speak?

---
 
### There are 7,106 living languages in the world 

<small>[(Source)](https://www.ethnologue.com)</small>

---

## We'd better get started!

---

# Aari
**Classification**: Afro-Asiatic, Omotic, South

**Spoken in:** Ethiopia

Best described in Hayward, Richard J. 1990. *Notes on the Aari language*. In Hayward, R. J. (ed.), Omotic language studies, 425-493. London: School of Oriental and African Studies.
---

# Aasáx
**Classification**: Afro-Asiatic, Cushitic, South

**Spoken in:** Tanzania

Currently being absorbed into Maasai, only 100 speakers left.
---

# Abadi
**Classification**: Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Western Oceanic, Papuan Tip, Peripheral, Central Papuan, West Central Papuan, Gabadi

**Spoken in:** Papua New Guinea

Around 4300 speakers and growing, although many speakers also speak Tok Pisin.

# What have I done?!?

![](img/terror.jpg)

---

### That would be doing it wrong.

* ... but *everybody* starts off thinking like that 

---

### "Oh, you're a linguist?  Cool!"

## "How many languages do you speak?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

### "Oh, you're a doctor?  Cool!"

## "How many diseases do you have?"   <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> 

---

## Linguists study Language.

* (Note the Capital "L", it's important)

* We study how Language works, how humans use it, and what happens in different languages to get communication done.

* Learning about languages can be a part of that, but it's not the whole!

---

### This class will teach you about Language, by talking about languages.

* Goal 1: Learn how linguists talk about Language

* Goal 2: Learn about the incredible diversity of language in the world

* Goal 3: Learn about the life cycle of languages

* Goal 4: Turn you all into Linguists.

* Goal 5: Talk about languages!

---

### So, "Languages of the world"...

* That's pretty ambitious.

* 28 lectures, 7140 languages = 255 languages/day

* ***NOPE!***

---

## We're going to focus on language families and areas

* Rather than talking about Spanish, and Italian, and French, and Portuguese, and Romanian, we'll talk about *The Romance Languages*

* Rather than talking about Hawai'ian, Samoan, Rapa Nui, Tahitian, we might talk about *Polynesian Languages*

* Rather than talking about the 850 languages (!!!) spoken in Papua New Guinea, we'll just talk about a few of them.

* *We will abstract to survive*

---

## We'll organize the course by families and areas

* We'll start with some information for your toolkit

* Then we'll talk about areas and language families

* We'll mix in lots of language-specific talks by gigantic nerds

---

# What do I have to do to get an A?

---

# Learn, then prove it.

---

## There are three types of learning you'll be doing

---

### Learning facts and relationships

* "Is German Indo-European or Afro-Asiatic?"

* "What morphological feature do most Wakashan languages have in common?"

* "Which of the below languages is critically endangered?"

* *** Facts are tested in quizzes and exams***

---

### Understanding Concepts and Ideas

* "What makes an Ergative language ergative?"

* "Why do languages with small consonant inventories have long words?"

* "Explain polysynthetic morphology in 250 words or less."

* *** Understanding is shown in exams and homeworks ***

---

### Interacting with languages

* "Tell me about Maasai speakers and their culture."

* "Discuss which feature of Turkish you felt was most interesting, and why?"

* "Construct a language, and translate "Velociraptors ate my homework" into it."

* *** This interaction happens entirely in homeworks and recitations ***

---

## So, if you want an A...

* You'll learn facts for quizzes and exams

* You'll understand concepts for homeworks and exams

* You'll interact with languages in homeworks and recitations

* You'll pay attention to the syllabus!

## Languages have different tricks up their sleeves

* ... and perhaps, it shapes our cultures and thoughts in return
