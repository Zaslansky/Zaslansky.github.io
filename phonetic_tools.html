# Phun Phonetic Tools
### LING 210 - Will Styler

---

## Hi, I'm Will

- I'm a Phonetician

- <strong>I have a problem</strong>

---

## Your head isn't transparent

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/sagittal_flesh.jpg">

---

### We care what you're doing in there

- How your tongue is moving

- What the various other articulators are doing

- How air is flowing

- How this turns into changes in sound

- How you're listening to and interpreting speech

---

### ... but we can't see any of it

- So how can we study and measure speech and speech perception?

---

### Four main types of tool

- Acoustical Tools

- Articulatory Measurements

- Imaging Tools

- Tools for studying Perception

---

# Acoustical Tools

---

### Listening and the IPA

---

### The International Phonetic Alphabet

A writing system used to transcribe what *exactly* is being said in any language of the world.

* The IPA is entertaining! - / ðə aj pi ej ɪz ɛɾ̃ɚtejnɪŋ/

* /rǂʛma/

* The IPA can be used to transcribe *anything that's being said*

* **Anything!**

---

### Acoustic Analysis

- Anything important that you do inside your mouth will affect the acoustic signal

- Listeners use the acoustic signal to pick up on what we're saying

- By studying the sound of speech, we can recover information about what you did

---

### Waveforms

### Spectrograms

<img width="70%" src="phonmedia/noisebbspectrogram.png">

<audio controls>
  <source src="phonmedia/noise.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

---

### Acoustic Analysis

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Very cheap
	- Completely non-invasive
	- Captures sound in real time
	- Gives us all the detail which is available to listeners

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Information is hard to processs
	- Doesn't tell us directly about articulation
	- Many elements affecting the same signal

---

### Sound tells us about the entire system

- Changes to tongue, voicing, lips, velum, all at once

- Many processes reflected in a single signal

- Sometimes, we want to measure what a single articulator is doing

---

# Articulatory Tools

---

### Electropalatography

- Create a fake palate with many, many sensors

- Measure, electrically, when and where the tongue is making contact

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/epg_1.jpg">

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/epg_2.jpg">

---

### Electropalatography

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Tells us when and where the tongue is touching the roof of the mouth
	- Gives very detailed time information
	- Looks at the shape of the contact too
	
- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Very expensive
	- Palates must be created for each participant
	- Doesn't capture many speech sounds

---

### Oral/Nasal Airflow

- "How much air is coming out of the mouth and/or nose right now?"

---
### Coarticulation

When we start preparing for the next sound *before it even begins*

* In the word "bend", we start nasal airflow before the nasal /n/, *during the vowel*

---

### Let's look at the airflow!

---

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/airflow_bend_annot_coart.png">

---
### Oral/Nasal Airflow Measurement

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Tells us directly about nasality
	- Reliable measurement
	- Not super invasive
	
- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Differs from person to person
	- Muffles speech
	- Requires an expensive system

---

### Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)

- Electromagnetic pulses around the head are picked up by tiny sensors

- Measures the position of sensors in real time, very precisely

	- Accurate to 0.1mm, at up to 1250 measurements per second

- We're using a Carstens AG501 here at Michigan

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/ema_will_18.jpg">

---

### EMA Data

<img src="phonmedia/M4_14_mview.jpg"> 

---

### Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA)

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Gives us precise position information
	- Gives us precise time information
	- Possible to study two people at once
	- No noise (in data or from machines)
	
- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Only gives us individual points (rather than the whole tongue)
	- Very time-intensive to collect and label
	- Sensitive to magnetic fields
	- Very expensive machines
	- Starts with "Now I'll glue this to your tongue..."

---

### Articulatory Measurements are helpful

- They let us measure what individual articulators are doing

- They give precise information rather than noisy signals

- They provide a "second opinion" for acoustic data

- ... but they still don't let us *see* what's happening

---

# Imaging Tools

---

### Trans-Nasal Laryngoscopy

- Pass a camera through the nose which can look down onto the vocal folds and pharynx

- Use a strobe light to "slow down" the vocal fold motion

---

Content Warning: Things are about to get weird.

---

### Trans-Nasal Laryngoscopy

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Inexpensive
	- Full color video
	- High Framerates

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Only useful for the larynx and pharynx
	- Requires a doctor to be present
	- "OK, now we'll stick this camera up your nose"

---

### X-Ray Imaging

- Pass radiation through the participant onto video film

---

---

### X-Ray Imaging

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Low noise
	- High Framerate
	- Available 30 years ago
	
- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Flesh doesn't show up well
	- Substantially irradiates your participants' heads

---

### Ultrasound

- Pulse high-frequency sound waves into the body

- Measure the patterns in which they return to image internal structure

---

---

### Ultrasound

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Poses no risk to participant
	- Can be done in any office/setting by linguists
	- Provides the entire tongue
	- Silent in audible frequencies

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Only shows the tongue
	- One Dimensional**
	- Can't visualize the roof of the mouth or other articulators
	- Very, very noisy data

---


### Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

- Strong magnetic fields can be made to cause hydrogen atoms to emit very faint radio signals

- These radio signals, with clever pulsing of the fields, can map the location of water in the body

- We look for the water corresponding to the areas we're mapping

### MRI

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Can visualize any structure
	- Can visualize any angle
	- Non-invasive
	- Capable of very fine details

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Requires access to an MRI machine
	- Very expensive
	- Will pull any magnetic metals in you out of you
	- Very loud
	- Very slow

---

## There's no free lunch

- No perfect balance of image quality, speed, noise, and participant suffering

---

## Tools for studying perception

- We need methods for understanding how humans hear spoken language, too!

---

### Modifying the Signal

- Change the signal and see how humans respond to it

---

### Remember that vowel nasality we were talking about earlier?

- Can we use that to tell "bad" and "ban" apart without hearing the last consonant?

### This is called "Sine wave speech", and it's *really* awesome.

- Processing sound in this way tells us what humans are *actually listening for* in speech

---

### Modifying the Signal

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Can visualize any structure
	- Can visualize any angle
	- Non-invasive
	- Capable of very fine details

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Requires access to an MRI machine
	- Very expensive
	- Will pull any magnetic metals in you out of you
	- Very loud
	- Very slow

---

## Measuring Speech Perception

---

### Response-based measures

- Reaction time

	- Measures cognitive load, processing time

- Accuracy

	- Measures absolute perception
	
---

### Response-based measures

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Easy to collect
	- Easy to interpret
	- Gets at the core of linguistic understanding

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- RT requires specialized equipment and software
	- Doesn't give very fine-grained information
	- Accuracy is all-or-nothing
	- Many things can affect reaction time besides speech perception

---

### Eyetracking

- Let participants respond by looking at pictures

- Track the position and timing of their gaze

- Humans can look more quickly and accurately than they can physically press buttons

### Eyetracking

- <strong>Pros:</strong> 
	- Very intuitive for participants
	- Captures decisions with fine temporal detail
	- Captures aspects of the decision-making process that accuracy can miss
	- Can measure cognitive load more directly**

- <strong>Cons:</strong>
	- Requires very expensive ($40,000) equipment
	- Analysis is much more difficult
	- Words and sounds tested need to be "imageable"
	- People still vary in the time course of perception

---

### ... and other tools

- EEG measures localized brain activity

- fMRI measures and localizes brain activity more precisely

- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation can temporarily disable parts of the brain

- *... and most other psychological measures can be applied to speech*

---

### These tools make perception measurable and studyable

- ... way beyond "I think he said 'bend'"

---

## These are the tools that Phoneticians can use

- To measure the sounds of speech

- To measure individual articulators

- To image inside the head

- ... and to understand how we're hearing other people talk

---

### For now, you'll stick to the IPA and careful listening

- But when you fall in love with speech, come find us

- The best part about phoneticians is that we love sharing our toys
