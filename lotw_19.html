### Tone is important

> One tonal slip-up led Mr Zuckerberg to claim that Facebook had just 11 mobile users instead of one billion.

> While most agreed that his pronunciation was far from fluent, most were also impressed that he had attempted it at all.

---

### Language use in Australia

* 76.8% of Australians speak *only* English at home.

* Australian *had* around 400 indigenous languages before Europeans showed up

---

> The number of individual languages listed for Australia is 390. Of these, 213 are living and 177 are extinct. Of the living languages, 7 are institutional, 18 are developing, 12 are vigorous, **35 are in trouble, and 141 are dying**. ([Source](http://www.ethnologue.com/country/AU))

### Let's talk about what we know about what's left

* (Australian Indigenous languages are really poorly studied)
---

### Indigenous Languages aren't spoken everywhere in Australia

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/aus_indigenous_pct.png"> 

---

### Major (remaining) language families in Australia

* Pama-Nyungan

* Everything else

---

### Pama-Nyungan in Yellow

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/australian_families.png"> 

---

### Australian Languages are definitely a *language area*

---

### Features of Australian Indigenous Languages

* Ergativity (often split)

* Few vowels (usually /i, a, u/)

* Few voicing contrasts

* Lots of places of articulation

* Taboos and "Mother in law" languages

---

### Split Ergativity

* Been there, done that...

---
<img class="big" src="lotwimg/ergtshirt_split.jpg">

---

### Few Vowels

* Tiwi (Isolate) - i a o u

* Warlpiri (P-N) - i i: a a: u u:

* Walmajarri (P-N) - i i: a a: u u:

* Wati (P-N) - i i: a a: u u:

* Dyirbal (P-N) - i a u

* Arrernte (P-N) - ə a

	* See?  Told you so!

Both Warlpiri and Arrernte are spoken by around 3,000 people.
 
---

## Taboos and "Mother-in-law languages"

---

### Taboo

A prohibition on a behavior, action, or topic of discussion based on moral or religious grounds

* *This is from the Fijian (Austronesian:Malayo-Polynesian) word *tabu* meaning *forbidden**

---

### Every culture has taboos

* Some taboos of action

	* Things which *must* not be done

* Some taboos of discussion

	* Things which *must* not be discussed
	
* Some taboos of conversation

	* People you *cannot* speak with
	
* These can and do change over time

---

Think about things that can't be done, topics that can't be discussed, and people you can't speak with.

* <danger>What are some taboos in American society *which have changed in the last 50 years*?</danger>

---

### Sometimes, we need to discuss tabooed issues!

---

## Taboo Avoidance

---

### Taboo Avoidance

Linguistic mechanisms to avoid breaking a cultural taboo

---

### Indirect conversations

Talking about something without really talking about it

* *"So, are you and Suzy... you know... being safe?"*

---

### Euphemism

A less direct or "harsh" word for a concept which we don't want to discuss.

* These turn into "safe" terms for tabooed concepts

* "Downsizing" vs. "Firing everybody"

* "Neutralize" vs. "Murder"

* "Vertically Challenged" vs. "Short"

---

### The Euphemism Treadmill

* Euphemisms must be replaced regularly due to "pejoration"

	* Pejoration is when a word takes on the "badness" of the tabooed concept
	
---

### How did we refer to the mentally disabled?

* "Imbecile"

* "Idiot"

* "Moron"

* "Slow"

* "Retarded"

	* This is now apparently "the R word"
	
* "Intellectually/Mentally/Developmentally Disabled"

	* Give it around 10 years before we have some new one
	
---

### Other terms on the treadmill

* lame / crippled → handicapped → disabled → physically challenged → differently abled → People with disabilities.

* shell shock (World War I) → battle fatigue (World War II) → operational exhaustion (Korean War) → posttraumatic stress disorder

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 

### Which of the following is *not* a euphemism?

A) "The facilities" for "Bathroom"

B) "Collateral damage" for "accidentally killed civilians"

C) "Dismiss" for "fire (an employee)"

D) "slaughtered" for "murdered"

E) "put to sleep" for "euthanize"

---

### These euphemisms can become institutionalized

---

### "Political Correctness"

Lays out strongly tabooed topics, groups, and ideas, then dictates "safe" euphemisms and approaches to discussing them

* The "safe" euphemisms change regularly, and proper use signals political sensitivity

	* "Colored" -> "Negro" -> "Black" -> "African American" -> "Black"
		
	* "Transgendered" -> "Transgender" -> "Trans"
	
	* "Gay" -> "Gay/Lesbian" -> "LGBT" -> "LGBTQ" -> "LGBTTQQIAAP"
	
	* (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Queer, Questioning, Intersex, Asexual, Ally, Panssexual) 
	
* Improper use or use of dated terms violates the taboo within this culture

	* ... and is a punishable offense

---

(Whenever you think about judging other cultures for weird taboos, just think about this system in the US.)

---

<danger>What are some other ways that we get around taboos of discussion in American society?</danger>

---

### Australian Indigenous Cultures have/had a rich system of taboos

* Mother-in-law can't talk to son-in-law

* Father-in law can't talk to Daughter-in-law 

* Of-age Brothers and sisters can't talk

* The dead aren't referred to by name

	* The word is removed outright from the language

	* This lasts 1-3 years.

---

### This leads to some remarkable taboo avoidance

---

## Taboo Avoidance in Australian Languages

---

### Mother-in-law languages

Specific "sub-languages" (grammars and vocabularies) for dealing with tabooed relatives

---

This is sort of an extension of the honorific registers we've talked about before.

---

<lang>Dyirbal</lang><br><ldata>Pama-Nyungan - Australia</ldata> 

* Two "forms" of the language

	* "Guwal": The general-use form of the language
	
	* "Dyalŋuy": A sub-form used only with tabooed relatives

---
### Dyalŋuy

* Has around 1/4 of the vocabulary

	* Doesn't have many specialized terms

* Uses different words for the same meanings

	* 'to ask' is baŋarrmba-l in Dyalŋuy
	
	* 'to ask' is ŋanba-l in Guwal
	
* The lack of words makes speakers resort to fun tricks to express themselves

	* Causative/Intranstive Markers

---

### Dyirbal speakers have a smaller, incomplete sub-language to manage this taboo.

* ( ...and we thought political correctness was onerous!)

---

### How about the death taboo?

* When somebody dies, you can't use their name

* <danger>How can you get around this taboo?</danger>

* <danger>What if the person's name was part of the language? (e.g. "Will")</danger>

---

### Non-specific name mentions

* Avoid mentioning the dead by using other names

* Don't say "Mary", say "that old brown-haired woman from Denver"

* Don't say "Michael Bay", just say "that guy who makes crappy movies"

* Borrow a word to replace the tabooed word

---

### This taboo avoidance is one thing that makes Australian Languages remarkable.

* ...and it's pretty awesome in the rest of the world, too.

---

### Wrapping up

* Australia had a rich linguistic scene

	* Then Europeans showed up.

* Australian Languages have a Language Area going on

* Pama-Nyungan Languages are the predominant indigenous language family there

* They've got awesome features.

* Taboo avoidance is awesome.

---

## Next time: More awesome languages that Europeans damned near wiped out!
