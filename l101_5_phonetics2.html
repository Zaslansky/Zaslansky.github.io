# Phonetics: The Sounds of Language (are awesome)

### Matt Zaslansky - LIGN 101

---
              
### Today's Plan

- Understanding vowels

- More on IPA Transcription

- Why are we learning some IPA, anyways?

- Some phonetic phun

---

### The Alveolar Ridge

- "Why is the alveolar ridge named that when alveoli are in lungs?"

- As suggested, "Alveolar" refers to the dental alveoli, the tooth sockets, and the ridge is on the Alveolar bone

- "alveolus" is a Latin word meaning (among others) 'a small cavity'
	- So, lungs and tooth sockets have alveoli!

---


## Vowels!

---

### Vowels are created by shaping your vocal tract

* A vowel is voicing passing through (and resonating in) an unobstructed vocal tract!

* If we change the position of the tongue, we change the resonances

---


<img  class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/voweltongue.png"> 

---

### Vowels are different from consonants

- They're always* voiced

- They can (and do) occur on their own. I.

- We describe vowels using different characteristics

---

### How many vowels are present in Mainstream US English?

A) 5

B) 5, sometimes 6

C) 12

D) 17

E) 21

### / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, əɹ, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- beet
- bit
- bet
- bat
- sof**a**
- bird
- but
- bot
- bought
- book
- boot

---

/i/ - beet, see, seen, sear, seal

/ɪ/ - bit, sit, tin, sill

/ɛ/ - bet, set, sent, fair, sell

/æ/ - bat, sat, pant, pal

/ʌ/ - but, sun, pun, lull (ə in sofa, amount)

/əɹ/ - bird, purr, earl, butter, clamor (this is often broken into two vowels!)

/ɑ/ - bot, saw, star, paul, pawn, (cot*)

/ɔ/ - corn /kɔɹn/, boy /bɔj/ (caught*)

/ʊ/ - book, hood, puss

/u/ - boot, who’d, loose, lure, loon

---


### Do you produce 'Cot' and 'Caught' differently?

A) Yes, they're two different vowels

B) No, they're the same vowel
	
<section class="clicker"></section>

---

### A note on /ɔ/ vs. /ɑ/

- These are two vowels for some people
	- Cot (/ɑ/) vs. caught (/ɔ/)
  
- For many speakers, these have merged in all but a few cases
	- I am not one of these speakers

- But even for some of those speakers, “horse” and “corn” still have /ɔ/.  (/hɔɹs/ and /kɔɹn/)
	- Also, “boy” /bɔj/

---

### What's the difference between /ʌ/ and /ə/?

- They sound the same, but we use /ə/ in *unstressed* positions in words

- If there's just one vowel in the word, and it sounds like 'uh', it's /ʌ/

- This is the same difference between /ɜ˞/ and /əɹ/ (although for this class, you can write /əɹ/ for both)

- More details [at this link](http://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/difference_schwa_wedge.html)

---

### Describing Vowels

- For vowels, we talk about three additional dimensions

- 1- Where is the tongue in terms of height?
	- (High, Low, or Mid)
	- Also "Closed, Open, or Mid"

- 2- Where is the tongue in terms of horizontal space?
	- (Front, Central, or Back)

- 3- Are your lips rounded or not?

### The IPA Vowel Chart

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_vowels_in_head.jpg">

---
<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ipa_vowels_with_tongue.jpg">
---

### Diphthongs

- Vowels where the tongue moves through the mouth

- Start at one vowel, move to another vowel

- Things like “boy” (/ɔj/), “buy” (/aj/), “bay” (/ej/), “boat” (/ow/), “cow” (/aw/)

- Others are monophthongs

---

### MUSE Diphthongs

/ɔj/ - boy, soy, toy, join, oil, Roy

/aj/ - buy, right, try, sigh, die, fire

/ej/ - play, bay, may, ray, lay, trail

/ow/ - boat, oat, wrote, pope, toll

/aw/ - how, now, brown, cow, prow, louse

---

### So, Mainstream US English has lots of vowels

- 12 Monophthongs

	- / i, ɪ, ɛ, æ, ə, əɹ, ʌ, ɑ, ɔ, ʊ, u /

- 5 Diphthongs

	- /ɔj, aj, ej, ow, aw/

- And we describe these vowels in terms of high-to-low, front-to-back, and rounded or not. 

---

### Now that we understand how speech sounds are produced...

- We can identify the proper symbols in the IPA

- We can start to transcribe speech using the IPA

---

### Online Audio IPA Charts are a useful resource

- <http://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/>

- We also have videos at <https://savethevowels.org/ipa>

- **Make sure the sounds you're using are on your quick reference sheet!**

- As is memorizing some words for each symbol and then process-of-eliminating

	- "Hmm, it's not the vowel in 'snack' or 'but' or 'boat', but it does "

### Discussion Sections this week are all about transcription!

---

## A few more transcription pitfalls

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/ipa_undertaker.jpg">

---

### Lies your writing system tells you

- The letter “C”

- “ng” is usually /ŋ/, as in “ring” /ɹɪŋ/

- “th” can be /θ/ or /ð/

- “x” is usually /ks/, as in axis /æksɪs/

- English does not allow double ('geminate') consonants

	- “soccer” is /sɑkəɹ/, crass is /kɹæs/

---

### Do not capitalize when making IPA transcriptions!

 - Capital and small-caps letters in the IPA mean different things!

---

### More lies

Sliced - /slaɪst/

- Buzzed - /bʌzd/

- Close (near) - /klows/

- Close (a door) - /klowz/

---

### Silent letters aren't real

- “k” in “knee”
- “b” in “lamb"
- “e” in name, I will cry.

---

### English writing is often ambiguous

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/xkcd_pronunciation.png">

(Image Credit: [XKCD 2819](https://xkcd.com/2819/))

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="ling_memes/tap_am_i_a_joke.jpg">

---

### Sometimes, consonants take over

- Words like 'cotton' or 'people' or 'bull' can have a final consonant which feels 'alone'

	- There doesn't seem to be a vowel there

- We refer to these as 'syllabic consonants'

- You can use /ən əl/ to represent that, or the IPA 'syllabic' diacritic (l̩ or n̩)

	- So 'cotton people bull' = /kɑʔən pipəl bəl/ or /kɑʔn̩ pipl̩ bl̩/

	- Note that for many, 'bull' is still /bʊl/

---

### You'll want to use the tie bar for affricates

- It's good habit to write /t͡ʃ/ and /d͡ʒ/ with the tie bar when they're affricates 

	- Rather than a sequence of two different sounds (e.g. "hotshot /hɑtʃɑt/")

- It's less critical for English, but it's good practice

---

### There is no I in team

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noiinteam.jpg">

---

### Words don't have one IPA 'equivalent'

- You're always transcribing somebody else saying them

- There is no such thing as an automatic IPA “translator”, and there never could be

	- ChatGPT is mid at this too

- Some dictionaries give you IPA, but badly 

- ... and we can totally tell if you used that

---

### Some symbols don't mean what they do in English

- /y/ : High front rounded vowel

- /j/: Voiced palatal approximant (as in 'Yes')

- /r/: Voiced alveolar trill (the Spanish 'rolled R')

- /ɹ/: English 'r' sound (as in 'red')

---

... by this point, you're likely wondering...

- ### Why the heck are we learning about the IPA!?!

---

### The boring answers

- It makes you think about how you talk *and* what you're saying

- It prepares you for future linguistics classes which will use it

- You can work for an airport announcing names!

---

### 1) Because your writing system probably sucks

- “They thoroughly and roughly wrought the boughs in the borough, through and through”

- /ðej θəɹəli n̩ ɹʌfli ɹɑt ðə bɑwz ɪn ðə bəɹow θɹu n̩ θɹu/

---

### 2) Because it’s useful to be able to write things down, even when you don’t know the word(s)

- (/r:!ʛma/)

---

### 3) Because you don’t always have a writing system to use.

- Seriously, many languages don't have one

---

### 4) To train your brain to hear differences more easily

- /θ/ or /ð/

---

### 5) To capture individual variations in speech

- Is it “sick”, or /ɬɪk/?

---

### 6) To capture dialect differences in speech

---

### RP (British English) vs. Mainstream US English

- /əˈlumɪnəm/ vs. /aljuˈmɪnium/

- /ɡəˈɹɑʒ/ vs. /ˈɡɛɹɑʒ/

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/sellyouriron.jpg">

---

- "Sell your iron to Walter Zion"

- /sɛl jəɹ ajəɹn tə wɑltəɹ zajən/

- /sɛl jə ajən tə wɑltə zajən/

---

### Oh, Boston

- park the car in harvard yard

- /pɑɹk ðə kɑɹ ɪn hɑɹvəɹd jɑɹd/

- /pɑ:k ðə kɑ: ɪn hɑvəd jɑ:d/

---

### 7) To impress/scare people at parties/bars

---

### 8) To write down things that aren't otherwise writeable

---

### /ləd͡ʒɪbɪɾəkwɑ/

- "He does a lot of work for /ləd͡ʒɪbɪɾəkwɑ/ rights"

- LGBTQIA(+), in the OED now as "legebetiquios"

### Transcriber's Delight

- “I said a hip, hop, the hibbie, the hibbie to the hip hip hop and you don’t stop the rocking to the bang bang boogie say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie the beat”

### There's one misconception I want to address

---

## "People in Africa speak only with clicks"

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/false.jpg"> 

---

### Clicks in Africa

* Clicks are used extensively in Khoisan languages 

	* (spoken by ~400,000 people)
	
* They've also been borrowed into Zulu and Xhosa, both Bantu languages (within Niger-congo)

	* (~17.6 million speakers)
	
* This means that only ~1% of Africans speak a language where there are clicks

* All of these languages have lots of non-click sounds!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/omg.jpg"> 

---

## "I could never do that!"

* Yes, you can.

---

# Anybody can pronounce any language!

---

### Speech organs are universal

* There is not a meaningful difference between your vocal tract and a San speaker's

	- [Small differences may exist](https://doi.org/10.1093/jole/lzx004), but the effect size is small

* The only meaningful difference between humans is practice!

* It's easier if you learn the language at a younger age

* There are no sounds English speakers "just can't produce", *with practice*.

---

### ... but that doesn't mean it's easy

* Make a Voiceless Velar Fricative /x/ (as in "Chanukkah", "Challah", "Bach")

* Make a voiced alveolar trill /r/ (the Spanish Rolled R)

* Make a voiceless palatal fricative (ç) (as in an angry cat)

* Make a voiceless alveolar lateral fricative (ɬ) (as in "nahuatl")

* Make a /!/ click between two vowels (/a!a/)

---

### IPA Conclusion

- The IPA is a great resource

- Do the interactive tutorial for HW1 to learn more about how it works

- Remember, you're writing down *what was actually said*, and your writing system doesn't help with that!

---

### It's always hard to figure out what to include in a LIGN 101

- We normally don't talk about speech perception in such a course, but...

- ***"Screw it, I'm talking about speech perception!"***

---

# Speech Perception is impossibly hard

---

Speech is flapping bits of meat around in your head and throat while you expel air.

* **Speech perception is turning the resulting vibrations in the air back into language**

---

### So, what do these vibrations look like?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sky.png">

---

### How do humans pick them up?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/ear.jpg">

---

### Then what?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/skyspectrogram.png">

---

### Then what?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/magic.jpg">

---

### "Oh, he's talking about that thing up there!"

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/skyphoto.jpg">

---

"Wait.  You can't do that.  You skipped a step.  Go back."

* **That step takes years of grad school to understand how little we understand.**

---

## We're going to ignore the "how" and focus on the "wow!"

---

## Let's do some speech perception magic tricks!

---

## Trick #1: Gradient Perception

### Trick #5: Hearing Tongues

---
	
### We may be hearing tongues
	
- We may be taking acoustics and processing it to build a model of the world
	
- Then using that model to understand what's happening in the other person's head
	
- Which then tells you the phones being produced
	
	- ... and lets you reconstruct words

### This is a woman you've never met, and will likely never meet

* She's 28 years old from Monrovia, Liberia

* She also speaks Liberian Pidgin English

* You've never seen her face, never conducted a conversation

* ... **and you still understood her.**

---

### I mean, seriously...

* You've probably never heard anybody with a Liberian Pidgin English accent

* You've probably never even heard anybody from Liberia

* You had no way of seeing her to judge how large or small her vocal tract was

* You couldn't rely on gestures or facial movements to help fill in blanks.

* You had no context to know which words she would or wouldn't say

* *This is a worst-case scenario for speech perception*

* **... but you all didn't care!**

---

### We don't seem to care that...

* Every person sounds different

	* Sometimes due to language background or social status

	* Sometimes due to differences in anatomy

* My vowel in "bet" might be acoustically the same as yours in "bit"

* No two productions of the same word by the same person are identical

### We adjust to speakers/signers in perception all the time! How we adjust to different speakers in production is even the topic of a whole field called Communication Accommodation Theory

"OK. Making speech is impossibly hard, and understanding speech is impossibly hard."

* **"... but... uh... we're doing it right now."**

## OK, OK.  You got me.

# Speech is impossibly hard, but we do it anyways

... but that's only because we're *really* awesome.

### Our ability to produce speech is *incredible*

* We flap bits of meat around in our heads,

* in precise, intricate patterns and series,

* without thinking, "trying", or running out of air,

* while walking, running, biking, or eating,

* ...and still get the message across.

### Our ability to perceive speech is *incredible*

* We're able to pull signals out of the air,

* parse them according to the rules in our minds,

* take advantage of tiny details,

* recover *huge* amounts of lost information,

* and wade through mind-boggling variability

* ... all without even noticing you're doing anything special.

### Signed language phonetics is just as amazing!

- Different modality, but similar sets of problems!

### Producing and understanding words is the most complicated thing you will *ever* do

* ... and you don't even think twice about it.

### Trick #5: Tone Languages

---


## Tone

Changes in pitch during the word change the meaning of the word

---

### Level Tone

"High" vs. "Low" (sometimes "mid" or "rising/falling")

<lang>Zarma (Djerma)</lang><br><ldata>Nilo-Saharan:Songhay - Niger</ldata> 

Yesterday - "bi" 

Wound - "bi"

<audio controls src="phonmedia/zarma_tonecontrast.mp3"></audio>

---
	
### **Which has the high tone?**

A - "Yesterday"
	
B - "Wound"
