# Clitics, Compounds, and other weird chunks of meaning
### Dr. Will Styler - LIGN 120

---

### We've talked about the idea of richer storage

- "Maybe we're storing bigger, analyzable chunks"

- And we've now talked about frequency having important effects

    - Frequency makes weirdness permissible

- Today, let's talk about some other strange chunks

---

### Today's Plan

- Clitics

- Compounds

- Closing the Lexical Discussion

---

# Some Clitical Thinking

---

### We've discussed 'word' being a slippery concept

- There's no clear definition that works well for everything

- Some multi-word chunks feel 'cohesive'

    - copy machine, phone charger, over-the-top

- Some affixes feel 'wordy'

---

## Clitics

Affixes that show word-like independence

---

### The 's Possessive Clitic

- girl

- the girl's book

- the little girl's book

- the little girl from Canada's book

- **This affix can attach to a variety of words with the same meaning!**

    - It can even attach to different syntactic categories!

---

### The 's copular clitic

- John's doing great in the class.

- Fixing the scooter you broke's gonna be expensive

- That car in red's super hard to find.

- **This has the same distribution as 'is', but acts like an affix.**

---

### The 've modal clitic

- I would've youghten him out of there had I known

- All the ones I've seen've been blue.

- The purple've sold out already.

- You already've seen it?

---

### They don't feel like affixes

- They don't have **selectional restrictions**, and can attach to most things

    - Compare '\*the car you wreckeds are expensive'

- They have **freedom of host**, and can attach to many lexical categories

- They appear to attach **after stress has been assigned**

    - Dígamelo! should be 'digaMElo' according to Spanish rules
    
---

### Clitics are strange

- ... and your book goes into more detail about how in Chapter 9

- But they're an example of something that doesn't quite 'fit' in a world of affixes and stems

- If we conceptualize morphology as only having two states, 'attached affix' and 'stem', we're gonna have a rough time.

---

### Clitics are attached chunks that feel like they're independent

- ... and force us to consider a morphology which allows gradient attachment

- What about the opposite?

- **Let's think about independent chunks, that feel attached!**

---

# Compounds

---

### Sometimes, separate words feel more connected than the space makes them seem

- 'Backpack' is not 'back' and 'pack'

    - Front pack and back pack

- 'Laptop' is not 'lap' and 'top'

    - 'I put my laptop on a desk, so it's a desktop computer'

---

## Compounds

Compounds are single complex lexemes composed of two or more lexemes

- Compounds can be two *or more* words. 'Blue cheese salad dressing'

- Don't get too hung up on spaces, dashes, and lacks thereof!

---

### Example Compounds

- Chinese: zhèn zhi̊  (press-down + paper) = paperweight

- Swedish: piphuvud (pipe + head) = pipe bowl

- Czech: lido-jed (human + eat) = cannibal

- Koasati: ʧonhǎtka (oʧona ‘metal’ + hatka- ‘white’) = bucket

- Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì (Dogrib): dlòotsǫ̀ǫ̀ (dlòo 'squirrel' + tsǫ̀ǫ̀ 'dung’) = 'peanut butter’ 

---

### Compounds form from high frequency use

- 'wrist watch' was an innovation, until it wasn't

- 'Lap top computer' wasn't always a 'laptop'

- 'data set' isn't a compound to most people, but it is to us!

- 'nail bed' is a thing to people who do fingernails professionally

---

### Compounds act like words!

- They have idiosyncratic or restricted meanings

- They have phonological and prosodic cohesion

- They act like stems

---

### Idiosyncratic and Restricted Meanings

- Not all packs on the back are backpacks

- rainfall, snowfall, \*hailfall, \*sleetfall

- You can dog walk somebody who isn't a dog

- A tower computer placed on the lap is not a laptop computer

- They can feel **idiomatic**

    - Their meaning isn't interpretable from their parts (e.g. 'kick the bucket')

---

### The meanings of compounds can be variably persistent by analogy

- Butt Dial

    - Butt text?  Butt telegram?  Butt email?

- Booty call

    - Booty text?  Booty telegram?  Booty email?
    
- Break a leg

    - Break both legs? Break everything?
    
- Big Mac

    - Little Mac? Mega Mac?
    
---

### Compounds have phonological and prosodic cohesion

- She gave me a Krispy Kreme Donut

- I had Five Guys for dinner last night

- Compounds can have specific tone patterns

- Phonological rules can apply differently within compounds

---

### Brown Coat

<img class="tall" src="img/firefly_mal.jpg">

---

### Compounds act like stems

- Affixes may not apply within them

- What's the plural of...

    - Lightsaber
    - Light year
    - Big Mac
    - Queen of England
    - Hunter-Gatherer
    - Cheese Platter
    - Toothbrush
    - Mousetrap

---

## Compounds have different semantic types

---

### Compound Types

- **Endocentric**: referent a 'kind' of one of its members

    - lipstick, swordfish, tower crane, textbook, cellphone, pocketknife

- **Exocentric**: referent is 'outside' of the members' meanings

    - pickpocket, laptop, blowhard, pushover
    
- **Coordinative**: referent is a combination of the members' meanings

    - Southwest, blue-green, dumpster fire, upper-right, freeze-dry
    
- **Appositional**: both members have the same referent

    - God-Emperor, Singer-Songwriter, Owner/Operator, Washer/Dryer

---

## Compounds have internal structure

---

### Endocentric Compounds have 'Heads'

- The head determines the lexical category

    - 'Light rail', 'overdo', 'dog walk', 'catsuit'

- The head carries the inflection for the compound

    - 'whitewashed', 'sidestepping', 'undertaker', 'cheese platters'
    
- The other element modifies or specifies the meaning of the head, it's the 'dependent'

    - 'What kind of stepping? Side stepping!'
    
- Endocentric compounds refer to a subtype of the head.

    - 'textbooks', 'grad school', 'cat show'

- If there's no head, the compound is exocentric!

---

### Head positioning is language specific

- English places the head on the right: Light years

- Spanish places the head on the left: año luz ('light year') -> 'años luz' ('light years')
    
- So does Tagalog: matang-lawin, eyes-hawk, ‘hawkeyes’

---

## Compounds can be ambiguous

---

### What's the head?

- I saw a French Literature Professor

- He's got a Justin Bieber Face Tattoo

- Borderline Personality Disorder Tests

---

### We can think about this in terms of trees!

<img class="wide" src="morphology/compoundtrees.jpg">

---

### Compounds are when multiple words end up stored like one word

- With specific meanings, phonological wordiness, and word-like inflection

- Unlike clitics, which are affixes that act wordy on occasion!

- ... which brings us back to that lexicon bit

---

# Final Words on the Lexicon

- Get it?  Words? :D

---

### We've talked about two possibilities!

- **Morpheme-based Lexicon**: Storage is expensive, so let's store the smallest parts and use rules to combine them

- **Word-based Lexicon**: Storage is cheap, store EVERYTHING and then use analogy to fill in the blanks

---

### Both have advantages and disadvantages

---

### Pros of a Morpheme-based Lexicon

- Uniting forms with rules can be very **elegant**

- The lexicon is **compact** and **efficient**.  Little storage space is required

- Rules can efficiently generate a *lot* of the variants we see

- Our analysis (forms+rules) **generates** legal forms, which leaves us ready for productivity!

- Phonemes and Morphemes sure *feel* real!

---

### Cons of a Morpheme-based Lexicon

- The elegance and efficiency is reduced as irregularity increases

- Non-compositional meanings aren't efficient

- Non-concatenative morphology is hard

- **Frequency effects are harder to account for**

---

### Pros of a Whole-Word Lexicon

- Storage appears to be pretty cheap

- Emergence is pretty compelling for explaining learning and language change

- Reanalysis works **great**

- Phonetic phenomena work **great** in a usage-based world

- Phonology goes away!

- Frequency effects come free with the model!

---

### Cons of a Whole-Word Lexicon

- Your students glare at you when you explain it

- Morphemes sure feel real in phonological and morphological rules

- Polysynthetic languages result in a combinatorial explosion

- 'Analogy' is magic, and ends up looking like generative rules when formalized

- It takes **forever** to accomplish anything

    - ... and it's just not workable for linguistic fieldwork

---

### Is there a middle ground?

---

# Yes!

---

## The Dual-route Lexicon

---

### Life in a Dual-Route Lexicon

- We're storing lots of words, including some frequent 'complex' chunks

    - Compounds and Common Morphologically Complex forms

- We also have the ability to decompose words according to rules

    - Affixes, Phonology, and Morphological rules are not opaque to us

- We choose the method of access that makes most sense at the time!

---

### The Dual-Route Lexicon Schematized

<img class="tall" src="morphology/dualroute.jpg">

---

### Put differently...

- "Store as chunks the things that make sense to store as chunks, but remember that there are patterns and abstractions!"

---

### Pros of the Dual-Route Approach

- Best of both worlds

- Frequency effects and whole-word-like phenomena are explained

- Analogy is done better than 'Magic!'

---

### Cons of the Dual-Route Approach

- We lose the simplicity of both sides

- Hello again, Phonemes and Phonology

- Now we have two systems awkwardly taped together

    - ... and we have to describe where they switch off

---

# Will's Hot Take

- Compound!

---

<img class="wide" src="img/soapbox.jpg">

---


### Whole-Word, Morpheme-based, and Dual-Route Approaches are all plausible

- None of them make predictions that are provably false

- They seem cognitively possible

- They account for relevant amounts of data

- They've all stood up to scrutiny in the community

- **We don't know which of these approaches is 'more real'**

---

### Linguistics is about analysis

- "How do I best explain what's going on in this chunk of language?"

- Theories are tools which help us 

- Every theoretical tool has strengths and weaknesses

- Some problems are *stupid easy* with one theory, and *ridiculously hard* for another

---

### You can analyze a given phenomenon with any of these theories

- You can make morpheme-based approaches deal with high-frequency phonological reduction

- You can make usage-based approaches deal with wugs and morpheme-driven processes

- You can make a dual-route approach account for all the data, and specify the switching pattern

---

### You can also open a beer with a chainsaw

- <img class="wide" src="img/beerchainsaw.gif">

- # <danger>... but that does not mean you should</danger>

---

### Choose the right tool for the job

- Look at the problem you have in the data

- Choose the approach that's best suited to address it

- ... and get the analysis done

---

### Maybe we'll figure out the cognitive reality of all of this some day

- ... but for now, I'm just going to use what works

- # ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

---

### For Next Time

- **No Class on Monday!**

- Wednesday, we'll look at some amazing data!

<huge>Thank you!</huge>
