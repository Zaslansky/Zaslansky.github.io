# The Anatomy of the Outer Ear

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- Questions about the Reading?

- 'Transduction'

- Overview of the Structures of the Ear

- The Pinna

- The Ear Canal

- The Tympanic Membrane

---

## Any questions?

---

## 'Transduction'

---

### We're going to talk a lot about 'transduction'

- *Transduction is a process by which one kind of signal, energy, or stimulus is converted into another form*

---

### We are surrounded by transducers

- Microphones

- Speakers

- Seismographs

- Thermometers

- What else?

---

### The auditory system is all about transduction!

- Transducing air pressure to mechanical pressure

- Transducing mechanical movements to neural signals

- Transducing neural signals into a model of the world

- **Thinking about transduction will help you all quarter!**

---

### No transduction is perfect!

- Energy is often lost

- The signal is often *distorted* subtly

- Sometimes parts of the signal are discarded entirely

- "What is being lost?" is another valuable question to ask!

---

## The Structures of the Ear

---

### Three 'Zones' that most folks discuss

- The 'Outer Ear'

- The 'Middle Ear'

- The 'Inner Ear'

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The Outer Ear

- The Pinna, Ear Canal, and Typmpanic Membrane

- Offers protection of the sensitive bits

- Provides Amplification

- Helps with localization

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The Middle Ear

- The Ossicular Chain, the Eustachian tube, and the surrounding space

- Provides transduction from air to mechanical movement

- Provides pressure regulation

- Provides limited protection via the Acoustic Reflexes

	- ... and dislocateable bones

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### Functions of the Inner Ear

- The Semicircular Canals, Cochlea, and Auditory Nerve

- Provides perception of orientation and motion

	- Via the Vestibular System

- Provides transduction from physical vibration to neural signals

	- Via the Cochlea and auditory nerve

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### We're going to go through the system in that order

- Outer, middle, inner

- ... and today, we're starting with the outer ear!

---

# The Outer Ear

---

## The Pinna

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_pinna.jpg">

---

### The Pinna

- Also called the Auricle

- The external apparatus of the ear

- Serves to protect the ear canal

- Helps with localization of sound

- Helps amplify sounds

---

### What does the Pinna protect against?

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_pinna.jpg">

---

### Ear canal protection

- Against pressure seals

- Against rain and water

- Against wind

---

### How does the Pinna direct hearing?

---

### Localization of Sound

---

### The human pinna is fixed

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_pinna.jpg">

---

### Not all animals have a fixed pinna

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/deerears.jpg">

---

### Not all animals have a fixed pinna

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/catears.jpg">

---

### The Pinna still provides some location cues

- Front vs. Back

- Up vs down

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_pinna.jpg">

---

### Pinna Amplification

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/hornwartime.jpg">

---

### The Pinna Amplifies sounds!

- Amplification is strongest around 3000Hz

	- Where lots of speech is!

- This is our first *distortion* step in hearing

---

### Some people pour rum and pineapple juice into the outer ear

- ... to make a pinna colada 

- ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

---

### Once sound leaves the pinna, it goes into...

---

## The Ear Canal

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The Ear Canal

- A long tube for air to travel into the skull

- Contains hairs, cerumen glands

- Around 1" long, 0.25" in diameter in adults

---

### Ear Canal Subareas

- Cartilaginous portion contains hairs and cerumen glands

- Bony portion has none

---

### Ear Canal (with surrounding anatomy)

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear_hairs.jpg">

---

### The Ear Canal is mostly protective

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### Cerumen (Earwax)

- Cerumen lubricates, cleans, and protects the ear canal

	- Also helps prevent some infections and fungal growth

- Naturally 'pumped' out of the ear with chewing and jaw movement

	- Let's check that!

- Should exit the ear naturally at the pinna

---

### Cerumen types

- People produce two different types of cerumen!

- The ABCC11 gene controls your earwax type

- Wet wax (AA Genotype) is common in European and African folks

	- Apparently also linked to body odor issues...

- Dry-Flaky wax (GA/GG) is common in East Asian and Indigenous American folks

	- Comes out more readily

---

### Cerumen Impaction

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cerumenimpaction.jpg">

---

### Cerumen impaction is a common cause of hearing loss

- ... and it's really easy to treat!

- There are even at-home kits

- **Do not stick things into your ears to 'dig it out'**

---

### Ear Candling is... not supported by science

- Not enough suction

- Nothing is removed

- There are *no* proven health benefits

- At best, you're getting ripped off

---

### Cerumen â‰  Saruman

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/saruman.jpg">

---

(Although, actually, both can be removed by flushing the area with water...)

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The Tympanic Membrane ('eardrum')

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_membrane.jpg">

---

### The Tympanic Membrane

- Blocks water and debris from entering the middle ear

- Partially transparent, made up of layers

- Captures sound vibrations, transmitting them into the *ossicular chain*

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/tympanic_labeled.jpg">

---

### From here out, 'TM' unmarked means 'Tympanic Membrane'

- ... so don't (tym)panic

---

### The Tympanic Membrane forms a seal!


<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### Why is this seal a Good Idea?

- Stops things from going into the middle ear

- Allows water to fill the outer ear without filling the middle ear

- Drums with holes have problems...

- One other issue we'll discuss later!

---

### The seal is not *required* for hearing

- People can still hear with holes or perforations

- Causes some troubles, but can be done therapeutically

- It can be rebuilt!

- ... but generally, you want that seal!

---

### The TM captures sound!

- It moves with air pressure variations

- ... and transduces them into bone movement

- More on those bones next time!

---

### So that's the Outer Ear

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### Wrapping Up

- The Auditory system is all about *transduction*

- The Ear is divided into Outer, Middle, and Inner areas

	- Eareas?

- The Outer Ear has the Pinna, Ear Canal, and TM

- ... and combined, they protect, amplify and transmit!

---

### Next time, we'll journey beyond the Tympanic Membrane

- ... and into...

---

## The Middle Ear!
