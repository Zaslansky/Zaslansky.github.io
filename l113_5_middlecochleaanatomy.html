# The Anatomy of the Middle and Inner Ear

Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

### Today's Plan

- The Middle Ear

- The Vestibular System

- The Cochlea

---

## The Middle Ear

---

### The Outer Ear ends at the TM

---

### The Middle Ear

---

### The Eustachian Tubes

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/eustachian_tube2.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/eustachian_tube.jpg">

---

### The Eustachian Tubes

- a.k.a 'Auditory Tube', 'Pharyngotympanic tube'

- Serve to regulate pressure inside the middle ear

	- Allowing release of vaccuum and pressure in both directions

- Not always open!

	- Opened by the tensor and levator veli palatini

	- Otherwise, you'd hear your nasopharynx more!

- Contains a bony and cartilaginous portion

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_medial.jpg">

---

### The Ossicular Chain

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

### Comprised of three bones

- Malleus ('Hammer')

- Incus ('Anvil')

- Stapes ('Stirrup')

- Suspended by ligaments and muscles

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ossicles.jpg">

---

### The Ossicular Chain connects the TM to the cochlea

- TM is attached to the malleus

- Malleus to incus to stapes

	- via little tiny joints

- Stapes to the Oval window

- Ligaments serve to support the ossicles within the middle ear

	- ... and allow them to pivot

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ossicular_chain.jpg">

---

### The Ossicles serve four important roles

- They promote the acoustic reflex

- They amplify the acoustic signal

- They match the impedance between (external) air and (cochlear) fluid

- They protect the cochlea

---

### The Acoustic Reflex

- Tightening the *stapedius* and *tensor tympani* muscles dampens the vibration of the ossicles

- This happens in (delayed) response to loud noises and our own speech

- More on this later!

---


### Enabling the acoustic reflex

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">


---

### Signal Amplification and Impedance Matching

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/middleear_netter.jpg">

---

### Impedance Matching and Amplification

- Shrinking from TM to stapes increases force and improves *transduction*

- Movement of bones matches the impedance

- We wouldn't want the TM to be on the side of the cochlea

---

## Protecting the Cochlea

---

### The Ossicular chain can be injured

- Usually from head injury, TM perforation, or pressure

- Massive 'conductive' hearing loss

- Usually at the incus-stapes joint

	- Sometimes at the incus-malleus joint

- An intact stapes usually means better outcomes

---

### This is a feature, not a bug!

- Better to injure the ossicles than cochlea!

- They can heal and repair, often

- [Prosthetic ossicles](http://www.gracemedical.com/products/ossicular-prostheses/) are a thing!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ossicular_prosthesis.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ossicular_prosthesis2.jpg">

---

### The Chorda Tympani Nerve

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/ossicular_chain.jpg">

---

### The Chorda Tympani Nerve

- Carries tongue sensation, among other things

- One more reason you want your ear drums intact, thanks

---

### That's the middle ear!

- The ossicular chain

- The musculature involved in the acoustic reflex

- The Eustachian tubes

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="humorimg/deeper.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

### The 'Inner Ear'

- Comprised of the bony cavities within the temporal bone

	- The 'bony labyrinth'

- Contains the cochlea and the vestibular system

- These structures are tiny

	- [The Cochlea averages about 9mm long and 5mm high](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-005-2750-9)

---

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_dissected.jpg">

---

### The Vestibular System

- Dedicated to balance and orientation

- Includes both semicircular canals

- Filled with fluid and a method of detecting movement of that fluid

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_dissected.jpg">

---

### More on this later!

---

## The Cochlea

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/outerear.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_dissected.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cutaway.jpg">

---

### The Cochlea is a coiled tube

- About 2 3/4 turns

- Uncoiled it'd be ~35mm

	- That's 1.378" in 'Murica

- We talk about the 'base' and 'apex' of the cochlea

	- The base is the widest part, the apex is the narrowest

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/bony_labyrinth_withcochlea.jpg">

---

### The interior of the tube is complex

- There are three 'cavities' within the tube

	- The Scala Vestibuli

	- The Scala Media (also 'cochlear duct')

	- The Scala Tympani

- The 'tympani' here refers to the round window

	- Not the tympanic membrane

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cutaway.jpg">


---


<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### These cavities are filled with fluid

- 'Perilymph' in the Scalas Vestibuli and Tympani

	- 'Peri' like periphery, outside

- 'Endolymph' in the Scala Media

	- 'Endo' like 'endonym', inside
	
- **The fact that there are two different fluids is super important later on**

---

### Connections within the cochlea

- The Scala Tympani and Scala Vestibuli meet at the *helicotrema*

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cutaway.jpg">

- The Scala Media terminates at the helicotrema

---

### The Scala Tympani and Vestibuli are continuous

- You could swim from the oval window to the round window

	- Push off the oval window, up the Vestibuli, to the Helicotrema, down the Tympani, down to the round window

- The Scala media terminates at the helicotrema

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_unrolled.jpg">

---

### The Round and Oval Windows are both needed

- The round window pushes out when the oval window (stapes) pushes in

---

### Cochlea-internal landmarks

---

### Reissner's Membrane (also called the 'Vestibular Membrane')

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### The Basilar Membrane

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### Basilar Membrane (think 'base of the organ of corti')

- This is the surface which sound is able to deflect

- Stiffer at the base, more flexible at the apex

	- Different areas respond to different frequencies
	
	- This is called 'tonotopic organization'

- Pressure waves cause basilar membrane displacement

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_unrolled.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_unrolled_wave.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/basilar_frequencies.jpg">

---

### Lots more on tonotopic organization later!

---

### So, the basilar membrane vibrates in different places depending on frequency of input

- ... but how do we pick that up?

---

### The Organ of Corti!

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/cochlea_cross.jpg">

---

### Key takeaways

- The Middle Ear gets sound from the TM to the Oval Window

- The inner ear is a cavity within the temporal bone

- It contains the vestibular loops and the cochlea

- Cochlea is a spiraling wonderland of different cavities

- The basilar membrane moves with sound

- The Vibrations are picked up by the Organ of Corti!

---

### Next time

- We're gonna corti like it's 1999
