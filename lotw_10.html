# Nilo-Saharan Languages
### LING 1020 - Will Styler

---

### Administrative Note

* For Monday, a new lecture topic: **"English is a linguistic trainwreck (like every other language!)"**

---

## Today's Agenda

* Why typology is *really* hard in Africa

* "Nilo-Saharan"

* Two common features in African Languages

* Songhay languages/Zarma

* Luo

* Kuliak

---

Although I haven't said it explicitly, this course is all about **Typology**

---

### Language Typology

The process of comparing languages and establishing relationships and universals among them

---

### Typology lets us make claims

* Sometimes, these claims are regional

	* "Turkic languages are agglutinative"

	* "Semitic languages use template morphology"

* Sometimes, they're universal

	* "Languages with SOV order are postpositional"

	* "If a language has the category of gender, it always has the category of number."

	* These are from [Greenberg's Universals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberg's_linguistic_universals)

---

Typological information is useful, but requires hard work!

---

### The Typology process

* 1) Pick an area to study

* 2) Get as much language data as you can from that area

* 3) Start comparing and finding links and patterns

* 4) Use those links and patterns to establish relationships

---

### Step 2 is a problem for African languages

* "Get as much language data as you can from that area"

---

### Indo-European - "As much data as you can get"

<img class="big" src="img/hugelibrary.jpg"> 

---

### African Languages - "As much data as you can get"

<img class="big" src="img/tinylibrary.jpg"> 

---

This is an even bigger problem for Africa because...

---

### Africa is big

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/africa_size.jpg">

---

### There's lots of linguistic diversity

<a href="lotwimg/africa_languages.jpg"><img class="big" src="lotwimg/africa_languages.jpg"></a>

---

### Linguistic diversity in Africa

* 1.1 *billion* people live in Africa

* 2000+ languages spoken in Africa (much higher, by some estimates)

* Nigeria alone has 500+ languages

* Entire *families* of languages are endangered

---

### Travel to Africa is complicated (in some places)

* 20 out of 54 countries currently have US State Department Travel Warnings

* Corruption is often a problem

* Getting to your language's speakers from a transit hub is non-trivial

---

### Language documentation is hard once you get there

* Sam Beer is going to talk all about that.

---

### So, we know a lot less about African languages than we'd like to.

* There's less data to compare, less research being done, and less funding to pay for it.

* This means that our language groupings are a bit looser in Africa than elsewhere.

---

... but we still do our best!

---

### Africa has four main language families

* Afroasiatic

* Nilo-Saharan

* Niger-Congo

* Khoisan

	* These were first laid out in Greenberg's 1963 "The Languages of Africa"

---

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/africanfamilies.png"> 

---

### ... but we're not quite sure about two of them

* Afroasiatic and Niger-Congo are pretty well accepted

* Khoisan has all the vaguely isolating, clicky languages Greenberg couldn't place elsewhere

* Nilo-Saharan has been called "Greenberg's Trashcan", as it has the rest

---

## ... but these classifications are the best we've got!

* So, we'll run with them.

---

Today, we're working with...

---

# Nilo-Saharan Languages!

---

### Nilo-Saharan

* Spoken by ~39 million (or more!) speakers

* Loosely grouped, typologically speaking

	* The evidence for Nilo-Saharan relies more on cognates than shared features

* Very diverse (almost as much so as IE)

* Contains some important (and cool!) languages and families

---

### Nilo-Saharan Languages

* Luo (~6 million speakers)

* Kanuri (4 million speakers)

* Songhay (3.2 million speakers)

* Maasai (1 million speakers)

* Kuliak subgroup (~15,000 speakers)

	* 10,000 speakers of Ik, 5,000 of Soo

* ... and many, many more that we don't have time to even mention.

### Features of Nilo-Saharan Languages

* Singulative/Collective Number System

---

### Features of Nilo-Saharan Languages

Singulative/Collective Number System

...

<audio data-autoplay src="humorimg/cricket.mp3"></audio>
 
---


### Singulative/Collective Number System

---

### English is a "Singular/Plural" system 

---

"Bad movie"

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/badmovie.png">

---

"Bad movie***s***" 

<img src="lotwimg/badmovies.png">

* This is called a **plural** form

---

(Armageddon was OK, I guess)

---

The default for a word in Singular/Plural systems is singular.

* If you want plural, **you have to add a morpheme**

---

In a Singulative-Collective System, **the default is plural**

* If you want singular, **you have to add a morpheme**

---

ŋɛɛti 'lice'

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img height="50" src="lotwimg/louse.jpg"></th>
    <th><img height="50" src="lotwimg/louse.jpg"></th>
    <th><img height="50" src="lotwimg/louse.jpg"></th>
    <th><img height="50" src="lotwimg/louse.jpg"></th>
  </tr>
</table>
</center> 

---

ŋɛɛti-n 'louse'.

<center>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th><img height="50" src="lotwimg/louse.jpg"></th>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>

* This is called a **singulative form** 

---

So, in Nilo-Saharan Languages, plural is usually the default, and singular needs to be marked.

* (but even this isn't always the case)

---

Beyond that, there aren't really specific features *across* Nilo-Saharan.

* **... but there are some features present in *many* Nilo-Saharan languages**

	* (and lots of other African languages)

---

### Two Common Features of African Languages

* Level-based tone systems

* ATR Vowel Systems and Harmony

---

## Level Tone

---

## Tone

Changes in pitch during the word change the meaning of the word

---

### There are two types of Tone Language

* Level (or "register") tone - Tone is categorized by pitch "levels"

	* "High", "Low", "Mid", "Rise", "Fall"

* Contour Tone - Tone is categorized by shape and *pattern* of pitch

---

### Vietnamese Tone Contours

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/vietnamesetones.jpg"> 

---

### Level Tone

* Very common in African languages 

* Usually "High" and "Low"

	* Sometimes "Mid", or "Rising", or "Falling"

---

<section data-background="img/clickerbkgrnd.png"></section> 

<lang>Zarma (Djerma)</lang><br><ldata>Nilo-Saharan:Songhay - Niger</ldata> 

Yesterday - "bi" 

Wound - "bi"

<audio data-autoplay src="phonmedia/zarma_tonecontrast.wav"></audio>

---

(Zarma also has rise and fall, but I couldn't find recordings of it)
 
---

### Tone is not intonation!

* Tone is a property of the word

	* In Zarma, "bí" for "Yesterday" *must* have a higher pitch. 

* Intonation does not change the meaning of a morpheme

	* It can change the meaning in a sentence, though!

* English has intonation, but not tone!

---

Now, our other feature...

---

## ATR-based Vowel Systems

---

### ATR ("Advanced Tongue Root")

<img class="big" src="phonmedia/sagittalsection.png">

---

### ATR

* Vowels with Advanced Tongue Root are "+ATR"

	* Vowels without ATR are "-ATR"

* Similar to the difference between the English /i ɪ/ ("beet" vs. "bit"), /u ʊ/ ("boot" vs. "book")

	* This is called "Tense vs. Lax" in English

* In ATR languages, it's *really* important

---

<lang>Dholuo</lang><br><ldata>Nilo-Saharan - Kenya/Tanzania</ldata> 

<img class="big" src="lotwimg/dholuo_atr.png"> 

---

### ATR Harmony

When all vowels in the word *must* be either +ATR or -ATR

---

<lang>Karamojong</lang><br><ldata>Nilo-Saharan - Uganda</ldata>

ɑkɪdɔŋ - "to castrate"

* ɑkidoŋ-okin - "for castration"

---

**ATR Harmony is common throughout Africa**

---

### Features of Nilo-Saharan Languages

* Singulative-Collective Number Systems

* ...

* ### Common features of African languages

* ATR in vowel systems

* Level tones!

---

*"Uh, OK... but why did you use "to castrate" as an example there?"*

**Because it's the best example I found**

---

## This represents a truth of field linguistics

* "The sentence you need when doing Linguistic fieldwork will often end up being awkward, embarassing, or absurd."

---

**Actual Sentences Elicited during 'Field Methods' in the CU Linguistics Department, Spring 2007**

---

<lang>Zarma</lang><br><ldata>Nilo-Saharan:Songhay - Niger</ldata> 

*ai feidzi woy de no yon go*

---

### Zarma ("Djerma")

* The most widely spoken Songhay language

* SOV order

* Vowel length

---

### Dholuo ("Luo")

* Spoken by around 3.5 million people in Kenya and Tanzania

* ATR Harmony

* Level Tone

* Differentiates "Alienable" and "Inalienable" possession 

	* You use a different word for "My arm" and "My laptop"

---

### Dholuo

*cho-go guok*

bone-POSS.ALI dog

'the dog's bone' (which it is eating)

*cho-k dhiang*

bone-POSS.INALI cow

'a cow bone'

---

### The Kuliak Languages

* A sub-family of Nilo-Saharan, three languages

	* Ik - 10,000 speakers

	* Soo - 500 speakers and falling

	* N'yangi - ~1 speaker

* Sam Beer will be talking about his (mis)adventures in Kuliak next Wednesday

	* Sam is awesome.

---

### Wrapping Up!

* Typology is tough 

	* ... especially when you don't know about many of the languages

* Africa's got four main language families (we think)

* Nilo-Saharan is big, and diverse

* ATR and Tone are common in African language

* Zarma is awesome

	* .. and "I'm at home" is *ai **go** fu:*
