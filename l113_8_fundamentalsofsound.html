# The Fundamentals of Sound

### Will Styler - LIGN 113

---

## Now we're pivoting into sound

- We're going to focus on the elements of sound that are crucial for understanding hearing.

- ... and we'll skip some of the other fun stuff!

---

### Today's Plan

- What are the properties of sound?

- How can we visualize them?

---

### Sound is compression and rarefaction in a medium

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

---

### ... but we need to talk about it more concretely!

---

### The Key Properties of Sound

- Duration

	- How long does it last?
	
- Amplitude

	- How powerful is it?
	
- Frequency

	- How often does it cycle?
	
- Period

	- How long does a single cycle take?

---

### Key Properties Continued
	
- Wavelength

	- How far can the wave travel in a single cycle?
	
	- What is the physical distance between peaks?
	
- Phase

	- That's next time!

---

### Duration 

- We talk about sounds in Milliseconds

	- 1 second (s) = 1000 milliseconds (ms)
	
	- Half a second (0.5 s) = 500 milliseconds (ms)
	
	- One Quarter second (0.25 s) = 250 ms
	
	- 1 meter = 1000 millimeters
	
- Duration is kind of boring for this class

	- ... but very important for language and survival

---

### Amplitude

- What is the difference in pressure between compressions and rarefactions?

- We talk about Amplitude in Decibels

- We'll get there soon!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200HzHigherAmplitude.jpg">

---

### Amplitude is related to loudness

- Loudness is the *perceptual correlate* of amplitude

- Generally, when amplitude goes up, so does perceived loudness

- **It's super complicated!**

	- More on this later

---

### Conceptualizing Amplitude

- Why is dropping a small book quieter than dropping a large one?

- Why can high amplitude sound be damaging and shatter windows?

- How does a car muffler work?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/muffler.jpg">

---

### Period

- How long does a single cycle last?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.005 seconds (5 ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/200Hz.wav"></audio>


---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.0025 seconds (2.5ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/400Hz.wav"></audio>


---

### Frequency

- "How many times does the sound cycle in one second?"

- Measured in 'Hertz' (Hz), also known as 'Cycles per second'

- 'How many periods can fit in one second?'

---

# f = 1/t

- f = Frequency in Hz
- t = Period in Seconds

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.005 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.005 = **200 Hz**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**

---

### Greater period = Lower Frequency!

- Longer cycles == Fewer Cycles per Second

---

### Frequency is related to pitch

- Pitch is the perceptual correlate of frequency

- Generally, when frequency goes up, so does perceived pitch

- It's complicated!

	- More on this later!
	
---

### Wavelength

- "How far does the wave travel during a single cycle?"

---

### Calculating Wavelength requires two pieces of information...

- How fast is it moving?

	- At the speed of sound! (343 meters per second)

- How often per second does it cycle?

	- That's the frequency!

---

### It makes sense that frequency is involved

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/wavelength.jpg">

---

### Wavelength is...

- Meters per second / Cycles per second

- You then get meters per cycle!

---

# λ = c/f

- λ = Wavelength in Meters

- c = Speed of Sound in Air (343 m/s for this class)

- f = Frequency in Hz

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.005 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.005 = **200 Hz**
- Wavelength = 343/200 = **1.715 Meters**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**
- Wavelength = 343/400 = **0.857 Meters**

---

### Lower Frequencies have longer wavelengths

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/wavelength.jpg">

---

### Conceptualizing Wavelength

- Why does a double-bass play lower notes than a violin?

- Why do subwoofers need to be bigger?

- Why do you hear your neighbors' bass, but not their treble?

	 - There are also differences in reflection of low vs. high frequencies

---

### Period, Frequency, and Wavelength are all related

- Frequency is calculated from period, wavelength from frequency

---

### Amplitude and Duration are not related to any other element!

- Nor to each other!

---

### We can find these things out for any sound!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

- Amplitude ≈ 0.4
- Duration = ??
- Period = 0.01 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.01 = 100 Hz
- Wavelength = 343/100 = 3.43 meters

---

### Wrapping Up

- All sounds have amplitude, duration, periods, frequencies, and wavelengths

- Many of these things are related to one another

- These properties have real consequences for how sound actually works!

---

### For Next Time

- What was up with that last sound?

- And why was it so bumpy?
