# Sign Language Linguistics
### Matt Zaslansky - LIGN 101

---

## ASL Structure vs. English Structure

- Two languages in two modalities
- <small>visual-gestural for ASL</small>
- <small>aural-oral for English</small>

- The two modalities exhibit different sub-lexical systems (e.g., phonology)

# Before we even talk about sign language
- Let's revisit some assumptions we have about langauge

---

###  Tom Holcomb’s five hallmarks of culture
- language
- heritage
- customs
- art
- family or 'cultural players'

---
###  Tom Holcomb’s five hallmarks of culture


- The existence of a language suggests the existence of a wider human
culture. Is this true for sign language(s)?

---
### Who are the cultural players for a sign language like American Sign Language?

- Does American Sign Langauge belong to the American mainstream?

	- Consider where sign language shows up in American culture.

---
### Who are the cultural players for a sign languages?

- If not other great apes, what about mer...men?

	- Note: The protagonist of the Shape of Water is 'mute.' Why not Deaf?

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/interpreters.png">

---
### Deaf people are the primary cultural players for sign languages

- Like Millicent Simmonds

	- Recent winner of the Next Generation Award from the Hollywood Critics Association.

---
### Deafness comes at different times

- Deafness can be from birth, from childhood, or later in life.

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/sound_of_metal.png">

---
### Deafness can be partial

- The speech banana

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/speech_banana.jpg">

---
### Deafness comes at different times

- This is why we distinguish between capital-D 'Deaf' and lower-case 'deaf.'

	- It's the difference between culture and a physical description.

> People are not born with culture; rather, they are born into a culture where strategies of survival are introduced to members of the community as they grow up. (Holcomb 2013: 17)

# Cultural practices

- All cultures have things they conventionalize

- Hearing cultures have certain things they share.

	- speech 
	- Sound as a signal: doorbells, alarms, car horns
	- Sound technologies: phones, microphones, amplifiers, speakers (in TVs, in computers, in shopping malls...)
	- culturally-specific idioms

---

# English cultural practices: idioms

- "It's raining cats and dogs!"

	- 16th-century England's thatched roofs

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/idiom_raining_cats_dogs.png">

---

# English cultural practices: idioms

- "It costs an arm and a leg!"

	- Portraits can be expensive (just ask Faith Moor)

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/painting_faith_moor_de_Laszlo.png">

---

# ASL cultural practices: idioms

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZCgTGwpic&t=4s">TRAIN GO/GONE SORRY</a> </small>

	- Deaf Americans have experiences with trains ...and probably missing them!
	- Not too unlike ‘that ship has sailed’ for English.

# Let's talk about American Sign Langauge (ASL)

---

# Deaf History 

- Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, b. 1787

	- Hearing American minister, neighbor of Alice Cogswell.
	
	- Fell sick after graduating from Yale, while sick at home got to know Alice.
	
	- Promised Alice’s father to find a place to send Alice for an education.
	
	- Cogswell sent Gallaudet to London and then Paris.

<img class="r-stretch" src="people/thomas_hopkins_gallaudet.png">

---

# Deaf History 

- Laurent Clerc, b. 1785

	- Became a deaf teacher after being educated at Paris’s National Institute for the Deaf.
	
	- Meets Gallaudet in Paris in 1815.
	
	- Follows Gallaudet to the U.S. in 1816.
	
	- 1st Deaf teacher in the U.S.

<img class="r-stretch" src="people/laurent_clerc.png">

## L’Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris

- Established by Abbé de l’Eppe in 1760.

	- First school for the deaf ever.
	
	- Public school supported by the Church. Government funded from 1791.
	
	- Finally: a Deaf community for what became French Sign Language (LSF).
	
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/paris_school_deaf.png">

---

## Paris before the National Institute

- Abbé de l’Eppe, b. 1712

	- Abbé de l’Eppe knew the adapted French fingerspelling.
	
	- He fell into a bad situation within the church and needed to find a way to redeem himself.
	
	- Met two deaf twins, decided to devote himself to their education, founding a school for them by 1760.

## Distinctive features in sign langauge phonologies

- handshape/hand configuration
- location
- movement
- palm orientation
- NNMs (non-manual markers)
- <small>Stokoe 1975; Battison 1978</small>
- more recently, handedness has also been identified as a feature in its own right, following Battison's initial observations
- <small>Brentari 1998; Eccarius & Brentari 2007; also my own Master's (Zaslansky 2018)</small> 

---

## Phonological parameters: handshape

- BASOC15 handshapes exist in a majority of ASL signs

---

## Phonological parameters: handshape

- BASOC15 handshapes exist in a majority of ASL signs
	
<img class="r-stretch" src="img/ASL_numbers_HS.png">

---

## Phonological parameters: location

- Forehead
- Ear(s)
- Nose 
- Mouth 
- Neck 
- Shoulder(s)
- Upper arm 
- Torso 

---

## Phonological parameters: movement

- Movement can be a path movement when it involves the arms moving

	- circular
	- arc
	- straight
	- diagonal 
	- tap 

- Movement can be 'internal' movement when it involves the fingers/wrists
	
	- finger wiggle

---

## Phonological parameters: movement

- Movements also have directions 

	- away from body
	- towards body
	- side-to-side
	- front-to-back
	- up-and-down

- which brings us to...
	
---

## Phonological parameters: orientation

- Orientation refers to which direction the palm of the dominant hand is facing 

	- palm towards the signer
	- palm away from the signer 
	- palm to the side 
	- palm up 
	- palm down 

---

## Phonological parameters: non-manual markers (NMMs)

## What about the phonological rules?

### Meet the phonological rules

- Weak Drop 

	- Input any symmetrical non-alternating two-handed sign, output the same sign now without the non-dominant hand (it gets 'dropped')

- Again, Handedness is now often viewed as an additional phonological parameter

	- Dominant hand (H1) vs. Non-dominant hand (H2) 
	
- Weak Freeze 

	- Input a two-handed sign with trilled movement, output the same sign now without the any movement on the non-dominant hand (it gets 'frozen')

- Note! These are phonological rules and so do not change the meaning of the sign.

---

### Weak Drop and Weak Freeze

- Weak Drop and Weak Freeze are both allegedly phonological rules that apply to two-handed signs.

	- But they're not made equal.
	
	- Weak Drop is the way cooler sibling. 
	
- Or at least, Weak Drop has been of more interest to academics

	- <small>Battison 1978; Brentari 1998; Sandler 1989; Schermer 1990; Eccarius & Brentari 2007; Morgan & Mayberry 2012; Zaslansky 2018</small>

### Stop trying to make Weak Freeze HAPPEN
	
<img class="wide" src="memes/weak_freeze_mean_girls.png">
---

### Weak Drop totally HAPPENS

- Input any symmetrical non-alternating two-handed sign, output the same sign now without the non-dominant hand (it gets 'dropped')

- This Symmetry Condition goes all the way back to Battison 1978: 

	- The Symmetry Condition
	- > When two hands are active articulators in the production of a sign, they will share the phonological parameters of handshape, sign, and movement (though this can be alternating or synchronous).

# There's even morphology

# The Derivational Rules
---

## Activity Noun Rule

- Input a verb, output a verbal noun ('act'->'acting')

    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_acting.jpg" height="230" width="230">
  </div>
</div>


---

## Characteristic Adjective Rule

- One handed 'adjectives' becomes alternating two handed 'adjectives'

  <div class="column">
    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_understanding.jpg" height="350" width="350">

    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_flexible.jpg" height="230" width="230">
  </div>
</div>

---

## Characteristic Adjective Rule

- We see allomorphy in the two-handed base forms, which become non-alternating in their characteristic adjectival forms

  <div class="column">
    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_quiet.jpg" height="270" width="270">

    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_taciturn.jpg" height="230" width="230">
  </div>
</div>

---

## "Ish" adjectives

- Input an adjectival verb X, trill it to output a derivational meaning 'sort of X' ('old'->'oldish')

	- Trill in the ASL tradition means 'repeated, tense/short motions'

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">
    <img class="wide" src="img/ASL_old.jpg" height="150" width="150">

### Weak Drop and Morphology

- ASL has three synonymous variants of dual number inflection on object-agreeing verbs.

	- a two-handed sequential form, a two-handed simultaneous form, and a one-handed sequential form (which appears to exhibit Weak Drop!)
	
	- This is known as overabundance in inflectional morphology (Thornton 2011)

- MOCK and ANALYZE are two-handed verbs underlyingly, but permit Weak Drop completely grammatically for singular arguments

- Two interpretations:
	
	- Phonological: P follows M and therefore cannot ever apply to a derived or inflected wordform.
	- Morphological: Weak Drop is only ungrammatical when the argument is a dual object for this class of verbs!

---

### Weak Drop and Inflection

- GIVE is a different class of verb that allows for Weak Drop to occur even in the inflected dual form.

	- Phonological: ?
	- Morphological: Weak Drop is tied to morpholexical classes

## Other Sign Languages: Hawai'i Sign Language

- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyVnDh7BQhU">Hawai'i Sign Language</a>

	- As opposed to the earlier name, 'Hawaiian Sign Language'
	
	- Not based off Hawaiian or any other language

---

# Wrapping up

- Sign languages are tied to Deaf cultures

	- Yes, some sign languages are used by hearing people, but Deaf people are the primary cultural players
	
- They have their own grammars
	
	- Phonology and Morphology
	
	- Even syntax!
	
- They also have their own histories, and some of them are endangered langauges with endangered cultures
