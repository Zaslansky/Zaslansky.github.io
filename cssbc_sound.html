# An introduction to Sound

### Will Styler - CSS Bootcamp

---

### Today's Plan

- What are the properties of sound?

- How can we visualize them?

- How do we think about amplitude?

- What are complex sounds like?

- What is 'phase'?

- Why do Fourier analysis?

---

### Why do CSS people give a damn about sound?

---

### Sound is compression and rarefaction in a medium

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

---

### ... but we need to talk about it more concretely!

---

### The Key Properties of Sound

- Duration

    - How long does it last?
    
- Amplitude

    - How powerful is it?
    
- Frequency

    - How often does it cycle?
    
- Period

    - How long does a single cycle take?

---

### Key Properties Continued
    
- Wavelength

    - How far can the wave travel in a single cycle?
    
    - What is the physical distance between peaks?
    
- Phase

    - That's next time!

---

### Duration 

- We talk about sounds in Milliseconds

    - 1 second (s) = 1000 milliseconds (ms)
    
    - Half a second (0.5 s) = 500 milliseconds (ms)
    
    - One Quarter second (0.25 s) = 250 ms
    
    - 1 meter = 1000 millimeters
    
- Duration is kind of boring for this class

    - ... but very important for language and survival

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

### Amplitude

- What is the difference in pressure between compressions and rarefactions?

- We talk about Amplitude in Decibels

- We'll get there soon!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200HzHigherAmplitude.jpg">

---

### Amplitude is related to loudness

- Loudness is the *perceptual correlate* of amplitude

- Generally, when amplitude goes up, so does perceived loudness

- **It's super complicated!**

    - More on this later

---

### Conceptualizing Amplitude

- Why is dropping a small book quieter than dropping a large one?

- How does a car muffler work?

- Why can high amplitude sound be damaging and shatter windows?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/muffler.jpg">

---

### Period

- How long does a single cycle last?

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.005 seconds (5 ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/200Hz.wav"></audio>


---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Here, 0.0025 seconds (2.5ms)

<audio controls src="phonmedia/400Hz.wav"></audio>


---

### Frequency

- "How many times does the sound cycle in one second?"

- Measured in 'Hertz' (Hz), also known as 'Cycles per second'

- 'How many periods can fit in one second?'

---

# f = 1/t

- f = Frequency in Hz
- t = Period in Seconds

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.005 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.005 = **200 Hz**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**

---

### Greater period = Lower Frequency!

- Longer cycles == Fewer Cycles per Second

---

### Frequency is related to pitch

- Pitch is the perceptual correlate of frequency

- Generally, when frequency goes up, so does perceived pitch

- It's complicated!

    - More on this later!
    
---

### Wavelength

- "How far does the wave travel during a single cycle?"

---

### Calculating Wavelength requires two pieces of information...

- How fast is it moving?

    - At the speed of sound! (343 meters per second)

- How often per second does it cycle?

    - That's the frequency!

---

### It makes sense that frequency is involved

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/wavelength.jpg">

---

### Wavelength is...

- Meters per second / Cycles per second

- You then get meters per cycle!

---

# λ = c/f

- λ = Wavelength in Meters

- c = Speed of Sound in Air (343 m/s for this class)

- f = Frequency in Hz

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/200Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.005 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.005 = **200 Hz**
- Wavelength = 343/200 = **1.715 Meters**

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/400Hz.jpg">

- Period = 0.0025 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.0025 = **400 Hz**
- Wavelength = 343/400 = **0.857 Meters**

---

### Lower Frequencies have longer wavelengths

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/wavelength.jpg">

---

### Conceptualizing Wavelength

- Why does a double-bass play lower notes than a violin?

- Why do subwoofers need to be bigger?

- Why do you hear your neighbors' bass, but not their treble?

     - There are also differences in reflection of low vs. high frequencies

---

### Period, Frequency, and Wavelength are all related

- Frequency is calculated from period, wavelength from frequency

---

### Amplitude and Duration are not related to any other element!

- Nor to each other!

---

### We can find these things out for any sound!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

- Amplitude ≈ 0.4
- Duration = ??
- Period = 0.01 seconds
- Frequency = 1/0.01 = 100 Hz
- Wavelength = 343/100 = 3.43 meters

---

### Interim Summary

- All sounds have amplitude, duration, periods, frequencies, and wavelengths

- Many of these things are related to one another

- These properties have real consequences for how sound actually works!

- Let's think about amplitude a bit more...

---

# Amplitude

---

### Sound Amplitude is pressure

![](phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg)

- Greater compression, greater amplitude

---

## Measuring Sound Pressure

---

## Where do we measure on the wave?

![](phonmedia/200Hz.jpg)

---

![](phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg)

---

![](phonmedia/amplitude_rms.jpg)

---

### We use Root-Mean-Square Amplitude

- Eliminates asymmetry between up and down

- Takes the mean amplitude for the sound overall!

- This captures the fact that sounds often vary in amplitude!

---

## How far away do I measure from?

---

### Distance matters!

![](phonmedia/amplitude_vsdistance.jpg)

- If the distance from the source is doubled, pressure is cut in half!

---

### There's a bit more to it than this!

- Moving the medium damps sound independently of this

    - Lower frequencies are damped less in air, hence seeming to 'travel' farther

- Vertical differences in air temperature can 'bend' sound up and down

    - When the air is warmer near the ground, sound bends upwards

---

### We know this to be true!

- Distant sounds are quieter

- You don't feel the pressure bursts from distant fireworks

- There is a 'safe distance' from an explosion

---

### Amplitude measures without distances are meaningless

![](hearing/amplitude_75dblimit.jpg)

---

### Amplitude measures without distances are meaningless

- Anything's safe for hearing if you're far enough away

    - "Just grab their measurement device and walk 'til it's legal"

- So, it's critical to give amplitudes with a distance

    - "20 Pascal at 1 meter"
    
    - "... measured at 90dB at 2 meters from the source"
    
    - "Less than 50dB at the property boundary"

---



## OK, so what units should we use?

---

### Let's start with a simple unit

- **Pascal** - Newtons per square meter

- Where a newton is the force required to move a kilogram 1 meter per second per second

---

### What's zero sound pressure?

- Nothing really is

- Quietest places on Earth (anechoic chambers) are ~1.9x10<sup>-6</sup> Pascal

- The quietest 1kHz sound we can hear is 2.00×10<sup>−5</sup> Pascal

- **We're humans, so we're choosing the human audibility threshold as 'zero'**

---

### What's the maximum pressure?

- The Planck Pressure?

    - The highest possible force in the smallest possible area

    - 4.63309*10<sup>113</sup> Pascal

- In Earth's atmosphere, the loudest possible waves are around 1.01x10<sup>5</sup> (101000) Pascal

- Humans experience pain in the 200 Pascal Range

- Humans experience long term hearing damage > 0.36 Pascal

---

### So our range as humans is...

- 200 Pascal highest tolerable sound with pain

- 63 Pascal for a trumpet half a meter away

- 20 Pascal can cause instant hearing damage

- 2 Pascal for a jackhammer a meter away

- 0.36 Pascal causes hearing damage over long term exposure

- 0.02 Pascal for a home TV a meter away

- 0.002 for conversation

- 0.00002 Pascal lowest detectable sound by humans

---

![](humorimg/side_eye_chloe.jpg)

---

## That's kind of awful

- Most of the scale is used for 'too damned loud'

- Any time you're using 0.00002, you're going to make mistakes

---

## Enter the Decibel!

- Decibels are logarithmic

- We'll use dB SPL (Sound Pressure Level) 

- We use a reference value of 0.00002 Pascal

    - The lowest audible amplitude
    
---

### dB SPL can be calculated from Pascal

- dB = 20*log10(Pascal/0.00002)

    - log10 is NOT the same thing as log or ln!
    
    - This will mess up your homeworks!

![](phonmedia/dB_vs_pascal.jpg)

---

### So our range as humans is...

- 140dB highest tolerable sound with pain

- 130dB for a trumpet half a meter away

- 120dB can cause hearing damage instantly

- 100dB for a jackhammer a meter away

- 85dB causes hearing damage over long term exposure

- 60dB for a home TV a meter away

- 20dB for conversation

- 0dB lowest detectable sound by humans

- -20dB Anechoic Chamber Quiet

---

### Yes, dB can be negative!

- Remember, 0 is our threshold for hearing!

    - ... and we're not all that good at hearing quiet things

---

## Aside: Decibels and Damage

---

### High Amplitude sounds cause hearing damage!

- 180+dB can break the TM and/or dislocate the ossicles

- Sounds over 132dB can rip the organ of corti off the basilar membrane

- Long term high amplitude sounds damage the stereocilia and can cause cell death

---

### What are the 'safe' levels?

- [Let's Ask ASHA](https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/loud-noise-dangers/)

    - The American Speech Language Hearing Association
    
---

### What are 'safe' levels?

- < 70 dB is *absolutely fine!*
    
- 70-85 dB is fine *in short doses < 8 hours*

- 85+ dB has the safe exposure time cut in half per 3 dB

    - So 91 dB is OK for only 2 hours
    
- OSHA requires hearing protection for anything over 90 dB

- Over 120dB is **not safe for any amount of time**

    - This is *instant damage!*

---

### Instant Damage Sounds

- 140-190dB for a gunshot, firecracker, artillery, nearby fireworks

- 150dB for Jet Engines and firecrackers and dynamite blasts

- Over 130dB causes **immediate pain!**

- 130dB for auto racing, jackhammers

- Over 120dB can cause **instant hearing damage**

- 110-120dB is thunder, stadia, chainsaws

- Most rock concerts are 110-120dB!

---

### Gradually damaging sounds

- 105+ dB for unmuffled motorcycles

- 90-100dB is very possible with headphones and background noise

- 80-90dB is common on busy streets and in subways

- Restaurants can easily reach 90dB

- 85dB can cause damage with long-term exposure

    - Blenders, Smoke Alarms, Hand Saws, and Machining tools can easily be in this range!

---

### Amplitude is complex

- ... but luckily it doesn't matter too much, much of the time

- It's important for you to know this, though!

---

### Let's think about more complex sounds

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/100+200.jpg">

---

### We've been looking at sine waves

- Sounds which have just one *frequency component*

- These are relatively rare in nature!

    - It's positively sineful that we've focused there

- Most actual sources of sound generate multiple frequencies naturally

---

### ... and our ears (almost) never just hear one frequency

- Because we're surrounded by noise!

- Noise arriving at the ear is additive

- We only hear one waveform per ear, no matter the source(s)

---

### So, we should probably talk about...

---

## Complex Sounds

---

### Complex Sounds

- Sounds which are made up of more than one *component frequency*

- Also, *aperiodic* sounds, which aren't naturally derived from specific frequencies

---

### We're going to work with simplified complex sounds today

- But the world is full of more complex complexity 

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg">

---

### How do we create complex sounds?

- By making multiple sounds at the same time!

- Or, mathematically, using addition!

---

<audio controls src="phonmedia/soundwtf.wav"></audio>

---

### Let's look at this process in a bit more detail!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_2x_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_3x_90_separate.jpg">

---

### You can add very different frequencies!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### Why would sounds be combined together using addition?

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_12x_separate.jpg">

---

### The sum of two waves is the sum of their pressures at any given point

- Which gives rise to...

---

## Interference

---

### Interference

- Multiple signals are 'interfering' with one another when they collide and affect one another

- *Affect* means just that!  Any effect at all!

- There are two main kinds of interference in audio

    - Constructive Interference

    - Destructive Interference

---

### Constructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **stronger**

- When peaks add together with peaks

---

### Destructive Interference

- When multiple waves combine in such a way that they become **weaker**

- When peaks add together with valleys

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### ... but wait

- Those sounds had the same frequency

- The same amplitude

- ... and the same duration

- One pair combined constructively, and the other pair destructively

- ### What's the difference?

---

## Phase

---

### Phase

- The point of the cycle in which a sound 'starts'

- The 'orientation' of the wave in time

- We measure phase in Degrees (°)

    - 0° is the base, and is the same as 360°

    - 180° is the exact opposite phase from 0°

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_phases_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase is important for adding sounds together!

- Sounds that are 'in phase' experience constructive interference

- Sounds that are 'out of phase' experience destructive interference

    - Also called 'phase cancellation' here

---

### Constructive Interference

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_ampbase_separate.jpg">

---

### Destructive Interference/Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_combined_separate.jpg">

---

### Complete cancellation is relatively rare!

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_amplified_separate.jpg">

---

### Phase effects aren't all-or-nothing

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_offbad_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_off_separate.jpg">

---

### Aside: Applied Phase Cancellation

<img class="r-stretch" src="img/noise_cancelling_headphones.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="hearing/muffler.jpg">

---

### Humans can't detect phase

- It doesn't matter what phase a sound starts on to us

- But it's crucial when making complex sounds!

- And phase is one of those concepts that shows up *over and over*

---

### Subtle Phase differences matter!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_3x_90_separate.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="diagrams/phase_3x_separate.jpg">

---

# Complex Sounds are everywhere!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/noisewaveform.jpg">

---

### How do we understand their components?

- Using spectra or spectrograms

- Using a **Fourier Transform** lets us understand the component frequencies and their phases

- 'This signal is made up of which component signals?'

---

### Here's a nice video on Fourier Transforms

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spUNpyF58BY>

"But what is the Fourier Transform? A visual introduction" by 3Blue1Brown

---

### We've been looking at waveforms!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/sound_diagram.jpg">

- They show the combined, complex signal!

<audio controls src="phonmedia/soundwtf.wav"></audio>

---

### Spectra show frequencies and their powers

- Also known as 'FFTs' or 'Spectral Slices'

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf_spectrum.jpg">

---

### FFTs give us the component frequencies

- ... and their power

- Phase is also recoverable using FFTs

- ... but we want time!

---

### Spectrograms show frequency and power over time!

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf.jpg">

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/soundwtf_spectrogram.jpg">

---

### Fourier analysis works for any complex sound!

---

<img class="r-stretch" src="phonmedia/complexwave3.jpg">

<img  src="phonmedia/complexwaves.jpg">

---

### Our cochleas are doing something like fourier analysis!

---

### Now let's look at some other sounds!
